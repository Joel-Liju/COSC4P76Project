2019-01-01, And tariffs are like a tax hike.  And rising interest rates are like a tax hike.  And a falling stock market is like a tax hike.  And eliminated regulations create health care costs and damage to the environment that are like a tax hike.  And...well you won't understand.
2019-01-01, Facebook literally just showed me prices at $1.84 that I took a picture of four years ago. I'm no mathematician but I don't think you were in office then.  tryagain TrumpResignNOW FakePOTUS
2019-01-01, Gas prices are down because crude oil prices are down because the market forsees a lack of demand during the recession that your economic policies are going to cause. It is luck just not the good kind.
2019-01-01, Border security is achievable via many methods. As a Democrat I absolutely support the need for strong borders. That said I do NOT support $$$ going to a wall or fence.TrumpResign
2019-01-01, Your ratings are low and expected to go down to 5 to life this year.

2019-01-01, Traders are selling off oil because the oversupply today will become a tsunami of oil supply when the expected recession starts.  If you think the US budget deficit is bad now........

2019-01-01, Energy independence would be good. Reliance on cheap oil from the Middle East is problematic!
2019-01-01, Home heating oil prices are up over last year. Food prices are up every week. Electricity costs are up. Health insurance premiums are ballooning. Over 40 prescription drugs are going up this month. Affordable housing is almost a myth. But heyyou magically lowered gas prices...
2019-01-01, It's like when my boss made a mistake on my paycheck and I told him about it and he said you've been making really good tips lately haven't you?  and I said yeah I have so can you get me the $22 you still owe me?  Two different things.

2019-01-01, USMCA is NAFTA! Not much changed in your deal except the acronym. So Mexico is NOT paying for the wall!
2019-01-01, It's because it's winter dip-shit. Gas prices are almost always lower in winter. https://eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMM_EPM0_PTE_NUS_DPG&f=M

2019-01-01, Do you think it's just luck that the stock market lost value in 2018?Twitler
2019-01-01, Trump can't toke about the stock market or the economy anymore. That's why he is running on gas prices which are still higher than 2 years old!
2019-01-01, why do you make dogs sound bad?  My dog is awesome  he's laying on the floor right now looking at me with such love!
2019-01-01, Shush now he's been promised a real estate deal in N Korea!Great economic potential! There's money to be made for Trump  so he will praise them.
2019-01-01, Not true. It may slow inflation but businesses aren't going to slash prices.
2019-01-01, When criticized @realDonaldTrump flies into a rage bares his teeth snarls and attacks like a junkyard dog. This former Navy officer knows he's not fit to lick the boots of the military heroes he's attacked: McCain Mattis McRaven and now McChrystal. TrumpShutdown2018

2019-01-01, He could have exited the stage with honor and integrity for what he did for New York the indispensable city. He threw it all away because he did not know when to fold em.
2019-01-01, Donnie only you take the word of despotic murders as gospel truth. Remember how that worked out for ya last time?
2019-01-01, Yep his own security agencies are never right and dictators and murderers never lie. Welcome to Trump Land were nothing makes sense and everyone is batshit crazy.
2019-01-01, Un is a liar and you're another.
2019-01-01, A country cannot defend itself with no allies. Trump is isolating us so that our only choices for allies are countries like Russia China or N. Korea. He only likes big tough guys.
2019-01-01, I'm not even sure where his own hair is. It's not that thing on his head.
2019-01-01, Where are you from? Are you even affected by mass migration of illegal aliens?  There are a lot of highway and construction workers being displaced by illegals.  And in motels restaurants and other jobs too.

2019-01-02, Me...as I watched @realDonaldTrump at his CabinetMeeting
2019-01-02, Pretty obvious he has made a deal with some buddy contractors for a hell of a lot of kickback on this project. Only reason he won't let this go. Same reason behind everything he does: lining his own pockets.
2019-01-02, For the true cost of NYT drivel they should cease incessant whining setting up a myriad of false narratives and character assanation of @realDonaldTrump; and read the goodwallsecuritystories by recognized legitimate scholars showing why walls are not wasteful!...Quote TweetNew York Times Opinion@nytopinion · Jan 2 2019For a sense of the true cost of his government shutdown Trump should spend less time rage-tweeting about Democrats' refusal to throw money away on his wasteful border wall and more time reading shutdownstories says the editorial board https://nyti.ms/2F2DfaT
2019-01-02, That is a lie and you know it. If it's true than prove it. Show specifically where money from Mexico will be paying for the wall through the new NAFTA agreement (yes I still call it that deliberately). You make these open statements that have no backup. No more!
2019-01-02, @realDonaldTrump Trump: "I think I would have been a good general but who knows?" Hey Commando Bonespurs my dog Lula did more 4 this country while walking the line for TSA sniffing for bombs at Miami Intl Airport. Yes she did this while you were sniffing Adderall & cocaine.
2019-01-02, Like other Big Government Republicans who never liked Reagan Mitt Romney wants to signal how virtuous he is in comparison to the President. Well I'm most concerned and pleased with the actual conservative reform agenda @realDonaldTrump has achieved.When did Republicans become obsessed with Reagan?The 40th president's name was mentioned 64 times during the last debate according to a Big Crunch news analysis.cnbc.com
2019-01-02, Unlike @MittRomney - whose feckless campaign gave Obama four more years to start race riots and demoralize America.

2019-01-03, It's COMMON SENSE to build a wall for the security of our nation. A majority of Americans want the WALL. Thank you for taking the hard stance that most gutless republicans have avoided for years.

2019-01-04, @realDonaldTrump Do u realize @TSA employees r not been paid. I'm pretty sure some of them voted 4u. Can u please loan my son some money 2 pay his bills until you open the government back up. Because I b got damn if he's moving back n my house. Sincerely a concern mom

2019-01-06, I agree Mr. Trump. And most if the people that oppose the wall have fences gates and locks around their house to keep people that aren't "vetted" off their property. Bigots I say!!!
2019-01-06, fences gates and locks around personal property is entirely different than a wall along one border of an entire nation.
2019-01-06, But the criminal who shot Cpl. Singh was NOT a citizen!
2019-01-06, Why do you think we the sovereign people who have drugs ruining our country need an open border? Women and children were not the only people and it is wrong to cross without requesting by the proper means necessary. Intrude in my house and you will get scolded.
2019-01-06, Most of the drug deaths have been provided from American Pharmaceutical companies. Illegal crossings are down and as DHS themselves report most have been caught at or near existing border crossing that already have walls. Have you ever been where the new "walls" are proposed?

2019-01-06, Well @johnlegend and @jadapsmith don't agree with them either so... I don't care who you are. Grown men holding young girls in abusive captivity and peeing in their mouths and sexually abusing them on tape GET NO PASSES. I can't even believe this is a thing.
2019-01-07, We the people need to hold Trump members of Congress and the news media accountable to the TRUTH.
2019-01-07, I respect the hell out of him for telling it for once like it really is
2019-01-07, The thing is: it isn't how it really is. It's how he perceives things and his perception is strongly skewed towards his own narcissistic beliefs. I mean last I heard he's spoken over 6000 lies in 2 years. Those are just the ones easily proven! That's terrifying!

2019-01-07, Good decision by President @realDonaldTrump to address the nation about the crisis at our southern border. Great opportunity to explain to the American people why we need more border security funding. The current situation at the border is indeed a national security crisis.

2019-01-07, Doesn't matter what he thinks. Networks will know if the ratings stunk they'll see that people don't want to hear the LiarInChief traitor's lie-fest. Networks have to obey ratings because advertisers pay their salaries. If the impact is big enough they'll learn & adapt.
2019-01-07, a 2-state solution is not a bi-national state. a bi-national-state is a 1-stae solution. Israel doesn't seem to want a 2-state solution as it says Israel would be too narrow without the West Bank & Israel wants access to the West Bank's land & water resources.
2019-01-07, Want some  with that ?For a  you sure do complain a lot?  Are your bone spurs acting up?!?  I talked to all of the former presidents and they said that they all agree that donald trumb is a HUGE coward!!!  Retweet if you agree!! 
2019-01-07, Just so we're clear Mr. President a person COULD jump off a tall building to see if they can fly. They shouldn't. The same thing goes for declaring an emergency in order to rob the military of readiness funds to pay for a wall that we don't need. @realDonaldTrump
2019-01-07, Seems to me that's his objective. Make the military as weak as possible so it will be ineffective in the face of Russian aggression. I feel like this should be some thriller/horror novel not our actual existence. I will Resist and Persist.
2019-01-07, Ronna I'm surprised that you're ALWAYS surprised at what liberals think say and do   which at this point is consistent and predictable. All Trump need do Tuesday morning is indicate that he'll make a MAJOR announcement during the Oval address. The MSM will be there.

2019-01-08, I think that @realDonaldTrump knew that the Manafort information was coming down and that's why he's decided to do a primetime propaganda film. What do you think?
2019-01-08, Considering democrats have compromised with Trump about this at least twice and Trump has reneged every time this is solely his problem and it's up to him to give in. Or resign that'd be best.

2019-01-08, Tonight when @realDonaldTrump addresses the nation let's all remember that the only crisis on the border is the one he created by separating families snatching kids from their parents blocking refugees from legally seeking asylum and putting lives at risk.

2019-01-09, The way that Democrats just behaved in our meeting at the @WhiteHouse is embarrassing. They need to get back into the room and get serious about solving the crisis at the border.

2019-01-09, Californians lost their lives and homes to the deadliest wildfire in state history. Instead of punishing survivors and politicizing this tragedy @realDonaldTrump should be working with @HouseDemocrats to combat climate change and properly fund our federal lands. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1083022011574747137 This Tweet is unavailable.
2019-01-09, Thank you Harley!  Glad to finally have a rep taking care of his constituents!
2019-01-09, If the Democrats cave and give @realDonaldTrump the wall he should name it The Nancy Pelosi Wall.  Would easily win the best troll in history.
2019-01-09, What's with @realDonaldTrump wanting to declare a StateOfEmergency along the border when there have been so many other things well within our borders left gone unnoticed. I'd say he's borderline crazy!Well actually he's well within that border.
2019-01-09, Oh Jimbo @Uncle_Jimbo like @realDonaldTrump you live in such an Isolated World but at least Don knows he could not run his resorts and golf courses with out foreign labor nor could have America become Economic Superpower last 50 yrs without Illegal Immigrants to do all the work!
2019-01-09, Where does that prove Illegals are the cause for our kicking the rest  of those countries butts?There are plenty of reasons America is awesome and we'll continue to be so without OpenBorders
2019-01-09, The cable ratings tell the story @realdonaldTrump's supporters want him to keep fighting for American safety & security.  Dems refuse to compromise the president already has acting in good faith.

2019-01-10, Federal workers are rightfully suing the govt. They also should get damages for the unnecessary stress you caused them. This will be returned to our coffers when all investigations are done and you will have to pay millions from your illegal deals.

2019-01-10, And neither is building a wall.

2019-01-10, Cheap shot....not surprised though; people with no class always look for the cheap shot to take. That was taken during HIS Presidency! He doesn't agree with TheWall project at all! His idea of fixing the BorderCrisis looked more like this....
2019-01-10, The birther movement.Mexico will pay for the wall.He has bone spurs.
2019-01-10, I read today that Obummer declared a national emergency 13 times no opposition. I believe Trump & his staff know what they are doing. Deep state rules no longer apply.
2019-01-10, If @realDonaldTrump really understood the humanitarian crisis we face he would have taken the time to talk to a single migrant child or separated family   he didn't.

2019-01-10, @realDonaldTrump Please excercise your absolute right to remain silent And get used to hearing that phrase from FBI agents while they take you into custody (That's adult talk for arrest)
2019-01-10, How do your supporters justify this???Trump (re: the wall): "During the campaign I would say Mexico is going to pay for it. Obviously I NEVER SAID THIS and I never meant they are going to write a check!"
2019-01-10, Not only has there never been a president who lies as often as Trump but there may have never been a human being who has lied as much.
2019-01-10, Yep.  I just checked.  The air forces of the Samarites Ammonites and Philistines weren't much to brag about in the 5th century BCE.Oh and Nehemiah worked for a "foreign king" (Artaxerxes).
2019-01-10, Ahh now THERE'S a similarity worth noting... both Nehemiah and tRump was/is the underling of a foreign power.
2019-01-10, HAHAHAHAHA. I watched Mexicans shimmy up and over that fence all the time laughing at those Border a Patrol experts.  BTW the walls for your prison won't be see through.
2019-01-11, Time for the wall. Sorry. It's not racist to enforce our sovereignty.
2019-01-11, Hitler tried it (fascism) and he was extinct. East Germany tried it (built the Berlin Wall) and radical free spirits made it fall. ....We have seen this before but they all failed. No one can build an iron curtain to separate/divide free people. -Humanity always wins!
2019-01-11, They hate President Trump more than they want to fix problems   even problems THEY acknowledged to be real and serious in the past! Democrats will do everything in their power to stop Trump in 2020.
2019-01-11, Why did this become a crisis when Trump's army lost control of the House?  Why was it not a crisis for the previous 2 years?
2019-01-11, So since the shutdown started when Republicans held House & Senate it's the Democrats fault? Poor argument or logic
2019-01-11, Winners respect winners. I'm sure all of the Clemson players and staff will be thrilled to meet the best President in United States history!

2019-01-11, What does it cost to do nothing? MUCH MUCH more.
2019-01-11, It's not about doing nothing. It's about doing what's really needed. Better border control better border asylum and immigration. The wall is not the best option. And stop the shutdown.
2019-01-11, This comment is totally irrelevant... what's this guys response to what was actually tweeted lol I guess he just had to say something laughable
2019-01-11, I don't want to see Mitt anywhere near the Oval Office. @realDonaldTrump endorses Mitt and this is the thanks he gets??
2019-01-11, Ok wall done! You won! Now open up the government!
2019-01-11, Selling out America to a criminal?
2019-01-11, Nobody said trump is anti cop.We're saying that he makes a big deal out of cop deaths by immigrants and not cop deaths by citizens. Both murders are bad. But head racist in charge only reports on one.
2019-01-11, You signed a blanco paper. Mexico Will never pay for the wall. Why should they? How can this wall pay many times over? You don't realise that this wall is just as usefull as bringing sand to the dessert.

2019-01-13, Ambiguous words
2019-01-13, When folks speak of "corruption" they're appealing to our sense of disgust which is a powerfuly motivating emotion. And what conservatives by definition find disgusting is women and minorities who don't 'know their place.'
2019-01-13, This is also why they don't see a problem with Trump's financial corruption or inability to tell the truth...those things are the established way of the white male world so all is in order.

2019-01-14, No a wall is not immoral. What's immoral is Democrats ignoring the dangers of their open borders agenda. What's immoral is Democrats jetting off to Puerto Rico instead of staying in DC to negotiate with @realDonaldTrump to end the shutdown. Americans deserve better.

2019-01-14, I find it hard to believe that @realDonaldTrump is paying for it out of his own pocket. My guess is that his campaign fund will refund the purchase. After he funnels the bills through his business and triples the price so he can pocket the difference.

2019-01-14, Speaker Pelosi called a border barrier an immorality.  Was it immoral for Democrats to vote for the Secure Fence Act in 2006? Was it immoral for President Obama's administration to build the same kind of steel-slat barriers that President Trump now wants to expand?

2019-01-20, 800000 have been staying home due to some shutdown.
2019-01-20, Now we all know trump has the power to know things like what is in a letter without opening it!
2019-01-20, His "gut" gives him that mystical power. It also informs him when big macs are ready.
2019-01-20, This imbecile is trying to give us something we already have in exchange for something we do not want for 5 billion dollars. How is this a great deal or art? Even a reasonable Republican has to consider this plain stupid.
2019-01-20, Not so "artsy" is he?

2019-01-20, @marcorubio it's so nice Republicans are endorsing shutting down gov't to push policy.  So I'm sure y'all will not object when next President shuts down govt for carbon tax gun background checks or single payer.
2019-01-20, If your intent is to drag her down that's bullying.
2019-01-20, She was responding to the poster who used the Alex Jones "Michael Obama" "Michelle is a man" disgusting hate speech against our former beautiful First Lady. So you can get off your high horse.
2019-01-20, That was perfect Santa we love you
2019-01-20, None of what u said is even remotely true. Even federal courts have ruled that many voter ID laws were passed to surgically  suppress minority voters. As usual you have no f***ing clue what you're talking about. 
2019-01-20, This person is either a troll uniformed or a ridiculous human being... in thinking all of the above.Super sad to see the propaganda spewing from the keyboard. Unfortunately all this is going to get worse before it gets better. Theres no reasoning even when it's clear as day
2019-01-20, We have started striking Iranian Quds targets in Syrian territory. We warn the Syrian Armed Forces against attempting to harm Israeli forces or territory.
2019-01-20, Israel has always taken illegal actions with complicity of the US and US Tax Payer's $3.5 Billion annually that we donate to Israel; @realDonaldTrump could build his fucking wall by withholding 2 years of Contributions to Israel
2019-01-20, Omg I love it!!!!! I remember the day that movie came out!
2019-01-20, You're not allowed to take something away and then offer to return it as a form of negotiation. That's the shit kidnappers do.
2019-01-20,  Howard Stern says Trump's border wall won't solve immigration problems: It's just something 'morons can get behind'' 
2019-01-20, Howard Altman (me) says the same thing.
2019-01-20, I just love my President! He tells it like it is!! Thank you Mr President from saving our country from Terany!!!!!
2019-01-20, That  sly vixen Terany has been up to no good again.

2019-01-20, Everybody saw the video Yes they did. You know the parable to Good Samaritan right? When I went through catechism the class learned Jesus's real point was Samaritan's were a discriminated against minority. That's not unlike the harassed Native American (and LGBT and refugees.)
2019-01-20, You're disgusting! Clean up yourself!!
2019-01-20, Let's not forget to add McConnell's name as well every time we mention the shutdown.
2019-01-20, I agree with you but Martin Luther King was a better man that I. I couldn't have walked a city block in his shoes.

2019-01-21, As the impending death of RGB creeps on(if she's not already dead yet) you will see the ramping up of hate for Catholics. When @realDonaldTrump  gets to pick his 3rd @Scotus it will make the KavanaughHearings look like kids play.
2019-01-21, Awesome story! Now do all of the US citizens who were killed by US citizens already in the US in the last month...I can't wait to see the numbers thanks!
2019-01-21, 58 people killed and 851 people injured by Stephen Paddock (an American) in Las Vegas shooting. I was there that night and will never forget. F@&k you.

2019-01-21, Yet all the school shootings all the massacres  and all the gay crimes I've seen so far are committed by white nationalists. Crazy that you use an everyday crime to try to get you point across .
2019-01-21, @seanhannity trashed President Obama about the number of times Obama golfed.TrumpTheLyingKing who said he would not have time to golf while in office has golfed 86 more times than Obama.Hannity and FoxNews of course have been quiet about this.
2019-01-21, He can only identify with structures that have his name on them. He sees this as a monument to himself. He doesn't realize that he'll probably be the only President in history to NOT be offered the option to be buried in Arlington Cemetary. How's that for a legacy?
2019-01-21, Well a great deal maker  like 45 should have been able to get his wall done when he had a @GOP majority in both houses!!! WHY wasn't it done then????

2019-01-21, So you want to deport Trumps kids? What about his wives? Do you understand that ending birthright citizenship is a complicated process? That it has been a huge factor in building this country?
2019-01-21, Did you have a temper tantrum because they made you go? You were there LESS THAN 2 MINUTES and you never mentioned his name.

2019-01-21, His main accomplishments are records for golf and lying. Ms Romney stop thinking the American people are that stupid
2019-01-21, So there it is. Finally a right winger admitting the truth that this whole push with the wall and stopping legal immigration is about controlling the demographics. That u guys fear being the minority. Don't worry you can learn a lot from people of color about being the minority.
2019-01-21, Seems like you report every violent crime illegals commit even though they commit at a lower rate than native born.  If you did the same for gun violence you'd be so busy you'd be outa our hair and we'd be safer for it.
2019-01-21, Hey @realDonaldTrump here's an idea (yeah ideas are foreign to you but stay w/me). You could end TrumpShutdown & get the wall w/out a problem. You say you're rich..you pay for the wall. What do you think? I didn't think so that's why CadetBoneSpurs is IllegitimatePresident
2019-01-21, You're assuming that all or even most of those things ONLY come from our southern border AND that a wall can't be circumvented. Wrong on all counts.
2019-01-21, Have you ever considered making sense?
2019-01-21, Donald Trump controls 1/3 of the US gov. He will do anything to keep the American people safe as under oath.  MAGA

2019-01-14, For the first time in a generation we have a president who is beginning to tell the truth about the crisis on the border. @RealDonaldTrump @JudicialWatchFrom Judicial Watch
2019-01-21, For the first time ever we have a president who thinks spending hundreds of billions of dollars and even more on upkeep for a 2000-mile wall through deserts and rivers and private lands a wall that could be breached in countless ways is the answer to border issues.Fixed it
2019-01-21, I don't have any respect for anonymous cowards.

2019-01-22, I think it's not just an attack on @realDonaldTrump. It's an attack on good people of all colors who don't subscribe to their insanity.
2019-01-22, How do they permit phones in a psychiatric hospital? Can someone find out where this person is and alert the staff of the contraband?
2019-01-22, Seriously stop getting legal opinions from a Fox commentator and turn the channel.
2019-01-22, They would be silly not to allow the govt to be opened. They've really put Americans in harm's way and those folks need some relief. EndTheShutdown
2019-01-22, >@GOPLeader says he wants Pelosi to reverse course and allow @realDonaldTrump to give his state of the union. Day 32.
2019-01-22, You know what @GOPLeader ?we're behind Pelosi on this.  This situation has been caused and perpetuated by @realDonaldTrump and @SenMajLdr and they need to fix it .  Open the government then discuss your wall like responsible adults- that's legislation

2019-01-22, @realDonaldTrump has called back to work (unpaid) 9000+ workers so his Base (Farmers) can get paid. This isn't a Government Shutdown it's Trump playing Dictator - Stay Strong or we'll be doing this anytime he doesn't get his way - America has lost its Senate - Not the House too!
2019-01-22, Actually it's the Russians aka Senate GOP that will be making the call.
2019-01-22, I'm sorry I'm so angry. My mistake (FOREIGN ENEMIES) although some of them are in the senate after all. They don't say a word.
2019-01-22, To be clear most of the media covering the "standoff" just proved with a single story what @realDonaldTrump has been saying about FAKENEWS and FakeNewsMedia .You just shot yourself in the foot with this story.
2019-01-22, i agree.  Another disastrous decision by SCOTUS.  These men and women have given their lives for this country and SCOTUS and this administration have just told them they aren't welcome.  Horrible. And SHAME on the conservatives.
2019-01-22, Resign
2019-01-22, The proposal outlined by @POTUS would reopen the government fully. It is the only proposal currently before us that can be signed by the President and immediately reopen the government.
2019-01-22, VOTE on the bill the Senate approved & the house passed. Override @realDonaldTrump veto. Need a Schoolhouse Rock to explain it? Are you also taking your directions from Putin? @VP 25th Amend. time. @POTUS clear danger. Our country & citizens are being damaged.

2019-01-22, Thank you for continuing to side with the American people over Trump and his corrupt agenda. You and the rest of @TheDemocrats have the full support of We the People.
2019-01-22, In all your years of political experience have you EVER seen such arrogance and utter disdain for Americans like that displayed by @SpeakerPelosi?
2019-01-22, I was wondering about the 70 years of combined experience of Speaker Pelosi & ML @SenSchumer vs. the 2 years of @realDonaldTrump. That's a 70:2 ratio or 3500% in favor of the problems at our Southern border & our terrible the immigration laws being Chuck & Nancy's fault.
2019-01-22, My kids on furlough and he had money in the bank to give him by for a month or two he's 25 years old his car payments were never late he called them up they put the payment on to the last to work with him you obviously have other problems with everything you complain about
2019-01-22, Everyone may not have the forethought or the ability to save like "your kid". Some people may have children and other expenditures that may not allow for this. You should really expand your thought process & be less shallow minded.

2019-01-22, WOW really? A teacher? Now I know I was no angel in HS. I experimented with everything. Yet never had a teacher do that. And we're from the same time period.
2019-01-22, His casual violations of the Constitution have made some people think it's flexible. It's not. We advocate impeachment & indictment for his violations.
2019-01-22, None of that explains why YOU are too afraid to face the press. Or Mueller...
2019-01-22, Frankly I don't like saying this stuff but the South needs to do away with their corrupt politicians who only give a damn about themselves and their political career.
2019-01-22, That's only one part of what needs to be tackled. All corruption must be dealt with because if we can't get runaway climate change & obscene economic inequality dealt with in the next 2 years it will be the bane of our species & much of life on earth.
2019-01-22, The compromise bill was the CR that you and Dems passed unanimously last month before Trump showed his spinelessness before Ann Coulter's insults.Pass that not the bill loaded with wall BS. Trump's unilateral desires are not a compromise.

2019-01-23, I'm thinking you thought that up ALL BY YOURSELF.  Impressive.
2019-01-23, The State of the Union is a tradition which has been carried out during times of war and peace turmoil and tranquility.  It is an important piece of our history and government.
2019-01-23, And it used to be traditional for the Senate to hold confirmation hearings on Supreme Court nominees.

2019-01-23, U.S. diplomats in Venezuela should present their credentials to President @jguaido. Maduro has no authority to expel anyone. And trust me on this one if Maduro is stupid enough to test @realdonaldtrump by harming any U.S. diplomat the consequences would be swift & severe.
2019-01-23, One more time the US intervention would create a never ending civil war like dozens of others the US created and then you would applaud more increases in military budgets. How about you not taking decisions about the leadership of other countries and respect international law?
2019-01-23, EXACTLY!But shame on me for my lack of compasiion for federal workers with 401k's and cushy benefit packages...The shutdown has cost more than the 5 billion..so Nancy's petty shit is incoherent and pointless. It's SPITE nothing more

2019-01-23, Considering he's asking Trump it's a fair question!

2019-01-23, @realDonaldTrump what happened with your judges today?  What caused you to back off.  I'm hoping there's another plan.  I only caught a bit of this story on radio today.
2019-01-23, Why does she get to make the decision on whether or not the SOTU address happens? Hold it somewhere else. Invitation only. Invite all of the SCOTUS and Congress except her.
2019-01-23, .@realDonaldTrump FYI in case they are too afraid to show you and you haven't caught up with your taped news yet. Sir have you considered that what you are doing which is contrary to the people's welfare could at some point be a reason to impeach you?

2019-01-23, It is .13% of the annual budget. No logic on earth supports the democrats opposition.
2019-01-23, Perhaps if the only logic necessary was % of the annual budget but when one adds feasibility sensibility eco system sustainability and eminent domain fights it no longer seems quite so logical.
2019-01-23, If Madura of Venezuela did like Cameroun's brutal dictator @Pr_paul_biya & hired the likes of @SPB_Global who are able to whitewash his mass murders in Washington he may have been able to last 37 years too. Hopefully @realDonaldTrump turns his attention to Southerncameroons
2019-01-23, History: 33 days of forcing families to work for free.
2019-01-23, The constitution only requires a President to give a SOTU "from time to time." There is no requirement for it to even be done yearly. So "we're supposed to be doing it" is misleading. It was always done in writing not a speech until the early 20th century.
2019-01-23, Ummmmm...now which truth would that be.. as everyone knows trump has no relationship with truth.. WTF.. we're missing absolutely nothing.. he can have one of his kkk rallies

2019-01-23, I can't wait to find out what kind of dirt the Russians have on you. 
2019-01-23, This is just xenophobic propaganda. Immigrants commit a smaller percentage of crime per capita than citizens. There's nothing you can do or say that justifies your war on the government workforce. Open the government.
2019-01-23, He who said the rhyme did the crime(s).
2019-01-23, He's the leader of the government. The government is not functioning and he said publicly he would take the blame for shutting it down. Giving a speech pretending he's doing his job is like a store owner holding a staff meeting when he's put a deadbolt on the door for a month.
2019-01-23, "The citizens of Venezuela have suffered which I pretend to care about because they have oil reserves. Today I have officially recognized the President of the Venezuelan National Assembly Juan  Guaido as the Interim Military Dictator of Venezuela."

2019-01-24, I hear ya. It's disheartening but remember that we can't chg the world overnight. We need to keep resisting and teaching love and kindness are truly the only way. I never knew there was so much hate inside so many especially those who claim to be Christian
2019-01-23, Trump: Things going terribly for Democrats. Everyone is reregistering as Republicans. I'm doing great.
2019-01-24, All jokes aside. @realDonaldTrump is not ok. He should be in a mental institution .
2019-01-24, Is it remotely possible that you believe any of what you say??  If it is it's a stunning exercise is utter delusion. If not how HOW can you keep saying these things? You once saw trump for the fraud he is. lhaveyounoshame
2019-01-24, I thought Trump was the second Hitler and the world was heading towards WWIII when he won but now realise this hatred was created by the media. So good to see the fake media being exposed.

2019-01-24, You said today about Nancy: what she said I though was actually reasonable we will have the state of the union when shutdown is over.  Good. You are just a slow thinker but give it some time and I am sure you will give up on the wall too.
2019-01-24, Lindsay saw how emotional and credible Christine Ford's testimony was compounded by how flasid their cross examination was. To his credit he chose (successfully) to throw a hail mary temper tantrum to swing momentum. To think that was anything else is nieve or disingenuous.
2019-01-24, You are right but so many are offended by using the words such as breeds or races.

2019-01-24, EXCLUSIVE: The White House is preparing a draft proclamation for President Trump to declare a national emergency along the southern border https://cnn.it/2FVxf4d
2019-01-24, @realDonaldTrump if you're declaring an emergency do it for a real emergency: ClimateChange. Stop scapegoating immigrants for our troubles. Immigrants have a lower crime rate than people born here. All the more reason to embrace their right to freedom of movement.
2019-01-24, Trump says he wants a "prorated down payment" on the wall in order to sign a bill to reopen the government. Something that already failed to pass the Senate today.
2019-01-24, I must be stupid: if the President promised a wall that would be payed for by Mexico; but then charges Americans because he didn't get the deal?Who is winning?Not America.Just a petty spoilt Man - who holds a Nation to hostage.History.@realDonaldTrump.

2019-01-25, American workers should never have been forced to suffer & sacrifice because @realDonaldTrump made a promise he couldn't keep. Public servants & members of our armed forces should never have been forced to wait in food pantry lines. We should never travel down this road again.
2019-01-25, Once we get our feet under us again we need to discuss LIVING WAGES.Working Americans - especially those called to protect fellow Americans - should not have to ride the razor of the poverty line. It's appalling.
2019-01-25, When Roger Stone was arrested one FBI agent pounded on his door and said FBI. Open the door." I'm looking forward to the day when @realDonaldTrump hears those same words!

2019-01-25, There is one and he's trying with congress proving that he has tried everything to get it approved that way. When it fails he will have the proof he needs to support that action.
2019-01-25, There really isn't. One bill about funding a wall went to the Senate & didn't pass. & just because he tried to do something & couldnt still doesn't make it an emergency.
2019-01-25, Yes it does.
2019-01-25, .@SpeakerPelosi you have three weeks to develop bipartisan legislation to enhance America's border security. If you fail or renege on the deal I call on @realDonaldTrump to build the wall using the powers granted to the Executive Branch.Madam Speaker don't let America down.

2019-02-04, He makes more money when he goes on a golf trip than he would be paid in the salary he refuses  to take not to mention the money he makes when he hosts  foreign dignitaries at one of his hotels. Sounds like a HUGE conflict of interest to me.
2019-02-04, Difference being that President Trump does not claim a salary and funds his own leisure time.
2019-02-04, Such BS! He doesn't pay greens fees because he owns the courses but the American taxpayers pay for travel on Air Force 1 plus the rooms food golf carts etc for him and the 20-40 or so secret service and staff that go with him. That's at least $1 million per trip!

2019-02-07, The most ridiculous part of GreenNewDeal is how they propose paying for it   extending unspecified credit from the Federal Reserve. However they reassure us that the question isn't how will we pay for it but what will we do with our new shared prosperity.  Shared Prosperity?

2019-02-08, The fact that the Green New Deal also eliminates new carbon-free nuclear energy indicates this plan is not about carbon emissions. It's about destroying our economy so they can build a socialist one. To Dems' credit at least they're being more honest about their extremism.
2019-02-08, It's about trying to preserve our planet for future generations.  It absolutely has flaws but at least there is an acknowledgement that climate change is a real thing.  Your party fails to see that starting with @realDonaldTrump GreenNewDeal

2019-02-08, Do you get your facts from @realDonaldTrump ?
2019-02-08, Got my facts from the inability to secure the required evidence to support collusion. In other words nothing is being done because nothing can be done without evidence which at this time still does not exist. No collusion seems to be the end result of investigative action.

2019-02-12, What I keep hearing is that the Baby born alive is not going to make it. Perod.So. If a baby has too many medical problems to live they keep it comfortable. I think you are reading into it what is not intended. Perhaps because for some reason it is still called an Abortion.
2019-02-12, unfortunately the wording of the NY legislation leaves everything very loose permitting 3rd trimester abortion and even post-birth abortion purely on the mother's mental health. It should have been more carefully worded to avoid potential abuses that's for certain.

2019-03-04, So you project a white Jesus to make a bizarre statement about mothers excluding fathers to deflect from your previous tweet suggesting people who are shot dead through self harm and accidents don't matter. Typical behavior of the @NRA gun cult of@waynelapierrejr.

2019-03-04, Seems quite possible that the dems had Cohen testify so Steele would have a reason to back out. Dems don't want Steele to testify bc it would prove this is all a WITCHHUNT & CoupDEtat against @realDonaldTrump & expose Deep State corruption.

2019-03-04, Grammar lesson for @realDonaldTrump there is one word used twice in Trump's nonsense tweet that doesn't belong the word no . The word ridiculous  is also used incorrectly it's ridiculous that Americans are forced to endure a career fraudster & criminally corrupt President.
2019-03-04, What are you afraid of? If there's nothing criminal there then nothing will happen? The more you rage scream & tantrum about the investigations the guiltier you look. Innocent people happily hand over information & cooperate because they know there's nothing there.

2019-03-18, He has profited more than any other president while in office.  This is due to all the foreign dignitaries and others looking to do business who stay at Trump's hotel in Washington DC.  Not to mention the increased revenue at Mar-A-Lago and other Trump properties.

2019-03-18, Dear @realDonaldTrump: How about this proposal: take your 400k salary but stop fleecing taxpayers to the tune of $91 million by going to Trump properties?The proposal also has the benefit of following the regulation that says you cannot use your public office for private gain. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1107771030385426432 This Tweet is unavailable.

2019-03-18, Mr. President I swear I've said this before but you lost the general "ballot box" election. You won the electoral college and haven't stopped whining ever since. FYI. The biggest scandal is still Watergate unless the Mueller report says otherwise.
2019-03-18, Same survey shows a majority (52%) say they have little/no trust in trump's denials that his campaign colluded with Russia while only 30% trust him.Not to mention only 1000 people were polled.  Not exactly representative of a country of over 300 million.

2019-03-19, So Trump has only accomplished two items on the list...
2019-03-19, I concur. It's very worrisome thinking about what a target our country currently is with the more than careless tRump crime family not using secure phones or emails. And tRump pissing off all of our former allies for his evil trio of his dictator girlfriends.
2019-03-19, Precisely my concern. I have faith in Mueller - but I fear we put too much on him while TeamTrump takes advantage of Mueller's code of silence.

2019-03-20, Today and every day I miss my good friend John McCain. It was a blessing to serve alongside a rare patriot and genuine American hero in the Senate. His memory continues to remind me every day that our nation is sustained by the sacrifices of heroes.
2019-03-20, Sen McConnell had nice words to say about Senator McCain.Sir you should have ended with and sit on this @realDonaldTrump you lazy incompetent corrupt traitorous degenerate! ForThePeople Maybe next time?
2019-03-20, Herr Trump now claims credit for the McCain funeral! He says as president  he had to approve  it. BS! Lying in state at the Capitol was up to Congress not POTUS. This despot has the gall to say a hero's burial is within his control. What a putz.
2019-03-20, I'm starting to feel like we will NEVER be rid of this horrible person. @HouseGOP @SenateGOP have really let down all of America. My great grandfather is one of the Founding Fathers. Every single thing this low IQ cretin does disrespects every American. @realDonaldTrump
2019-03-20, She will never once tweet about a dying veteran or someone killed by an illegal. She's so anti-American because she was PAID to be anti-American. She's a national disgrace - and I wish one day she will feel ashamed of herself. Americans dodged a bullet when @realDonaldTrump won.
2019-03-20, Bradley  just saying something does not make it true.
2019-03-20, How embarrassing for a president to disrespect a war hero like John McCain publicly. You are a disgrace to the office. Republicans are spineless not to call you out on this complete lack of judgement and example of weak character.
2019-03-20, Well said. Very disrespectful. The dead cannot defend themselves. So he thinks he is tough 
2019-03-20, .@realDonaldTrump take note. The American people will no longer tolerate a government which only works for the billionaires and massive corporations. We are going to defeat you and create a government that works for all.

2019-03-20, We know that Trump's businesses were involved in tax evasion embezzlement racketeering pay for play & other financial fraud for decades and don't forget the sexual assaults.Who actually believes that a serial con artist didn't pounce on Russia's offer of election hacking?

2019-04-08, I used to like your show but by aligning yourself with such a lying idiot you are becoming a has-been and unforgivable journalist. Trump condemns all journalists so can't believe you support his shit show. You are one of his "enemies of the people." So long.

2019-04-08, She was fired. Forced to resign is the same as firing. And let's be clear on this: Sec Nielsen was fired because she wasn't cruel enough. Trump wants an even more cruel person in that role because @realDonaldTrump is the sickest man to ever steal the White House.

2019-04-18, In fairness he's an ambassador for @realDonaldTrump. The bar is pretty low.
2019-04-18, Dude you wanted HRC to be POTUS so don't talk about low bars!This is a woman that was stupid enough to traffic SAP Top Secret emails on a private unsecured server. The intelligence community said up to 5 different countries hacked her system.

2019-04-18, There were lots of crimes but you can't be prosecuted because you're president (which is insane) and your son is too fucking dumb to confirm he knew when he was committing crimes. Other than that yeah totally.
2019-04-18, C'mon say it isn't so! Really? half? I'd have thought it would be as high as 80% who disapprove. I'm basing this on the values and training we went through to instill the characteristics of teamwork respect responsibility and principles of professionalism. tRump is lacking.
2019-04-18, I wouldn't take legal advice from Martha.According to federal law obstruction occurs when a person tries to impede or influence a trial investigation or other official proceedings. You are not exonerated.

2019-04-18, The Mueller Dossier spends nearly 200 pages breathlessly documenting immaterial unsubstantial legal or yes appropriate contacts between Russians and @RealDonaldTrump world.
2019-04-18, It's not a dossier. It's a report of a legitimate investigation. And I've still not seen you answer the question as to why they all LIED about every single contact with every Russian. Nor did anyone report any of the attempts at contacts even after warned by the FBI.
2019-04-18, When did you open this quotation?
2019-04-18, Which is why I don't understand Mueller's inability to make that accusation with clarity. He had enough evidence. He also should've subpoena Trump. Prosecuters caving to Trump's litigation ploys is why he keeps getting away with things.
2019-04-18, Somebody on @msnbc said today that Mueller didn't subpoena the orange crap bag because it would have taken two years to go through the courts. Mueller believed time was of the essence and that we had a right to know specifics sooner rather than later.

2019-04-19, A thing to keep in mind is there is an old DOJ policy that says they can't indict a sitting president because it would hurt his abilty to govern. Mueller kept this consideration.

2019-04-22, Joe Biden has been losing presidential elections since the 1980s.  2020 will be no different. Biden will have to answer for all the Obama-Biden failures   from Russian meddling to the weakest recovery since the Great Depression.

2019-04-22, @realDonaldTrump Can never do a town hall like this. He can't be coherent for an hour or answer the simplest question about policy or law.Quote TweetBarbara Malmet@B52Malmet · Apr 22 2019.@amyklobuchar is first up on @CNN back to back Town Halls. Here's her reply to a question about running against the current occupant of the White House.
2019-04-22, 57% of registered voters disapprove of Trump's job performance 39% approve. The 18-point deficit marks Trump's worst net approval rating since he took office in the Morning Consult/Politico poll.
2019-04-22, Get off the pot @realDonaldTrump. Stop tweeting and DeleteYourAccount. What say you @jack? Time to suspend him for violating the rules?
2019-04-22, Oh please. Let's give the heartland a little more credit than that.
2019-04-22, I doubt that the heartland feels that way. They're not that stupid they can read there's enough in Mueller's redacted report to make anyone suspicious of what actually went on. And investigation by Congress is necessary to back up Mueller's findings
2019-04-22, Blimp at the ready
2019-04-22, So Mr. 45 you expect us to believe you over those sworn testimony? And you was to chicken shit to sit with the special counsel to give a truthful testimony
2019-04-22, I would bet everything I own that @realDonaldTrump hasn't read the MuellerReport. It's wild how confidently I can say that.
2019-04-22, Ignored it? He participated
2019-04-22, Just the tip of a huge dirty iceberg...............
2019-04-22, . @realDonaldTrump just hit an all time low in the approval ratings.  Guarantee he will go much lower.
2019-04-22, I teach Federal Courts (a class that among other things focuses on different mechanisms for raising legal questions in court) and I can't think of another example in which a sitting President sued members of Congress. Ever.If nothing else @realDonaldTrump is good for exams.
2019-04-22, Trump sues everyone and usually loses.

2019-04-22, I stand by my reporting unless you plan to sue.
2019-04-22, Fair enough. It's hard to imagine that Mueller had become so senile that he didnt realize big problems with dossier. Hell he should have known that there were big problems with it as soon as he read it. It seemed ludicrous to me on its face.
2019-04-22, Yeah where is all that free govt healthcare trump promised? Seems the only guy still talking about it is @BernieSanders
2019-04-22, Donald just can't decide whether this report "exonerates" him or whether it shouldn't be trusted. Which is it Louie? You attack a war hero and well-reputed life-long public servant? You have an answer why Trump would tweet this right after he claims the report's "exculpatory"?

2019-04-22, Average monthly job creation in Trump's first 26 months was lower than Obama's last 26 months. Does that sound like a "soaring job market" to you?

2019-05-02, no he's righti know a lot of people who sayGod... Dammit...Every time they hear the name @REALdonaldtrump
2019-05-02, .@realdonaldtrump is giving the pres. medal of freedom to @TigerWoods who's a Trump biz partner. Here's Trump Org's magazine for 2018.
2019-05-02, I did not know that @TigerWoods is trump's business partner. Up until now I cheered for him hoping that he had overcome his problems in life. I will not be cheering for him any more.
2019-05-02, I'm praying that you resign.
2019-05-02, No way you wrote this.
2019-05-02, The weasel speaks
2019-05-02, What about the Muslim ban???
2019-05-03, Are you watching as closely as this ?
2019-05-03, Yes they took in between $42 and $46 million on asset forfeitures.
2019-05-03, Google execs were crying after the election and set out to make sure to change 2020.They have taken out so many of the prominent voices that supported you in 2016. Retribution by Silicon Valley.Milo & Gavin & so many others I can't even remember right now. The list is long.
2019-05-03, they're working on @scrowder right now for no good reason
2019-05-03, hmmmm. An Amendment in the Constitution - yeah I've heard of that - I think I'll pretend to be Presidential and quote it. Sounds like a good bite should get some good ratings - I'll sound bigly smart!!!  impeach potus
2019-05-03, Will this be a national emergency  as well?  Looking into it?  What's that mean?  BARR spying?
2019-05-03, Yes thank you Mr President we Conservatives have free speech rights as well! God bless you!!
2019-05-03, Thank you Mr. President. Now hopefully Facebook will be stripped of its immunity under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act because it is clearly acting as a partisan publisher and not a platform. This is election meddling.
2019-05-03, Election meddling!  Trump knows all about that!
2019-05-03, Don't like it? Start your own platform. Facebook and Twitter are private companies.
2019-05-03, It's the best he can do for support and at this point he can't afford to lose even one vote.
2019-05-03, I'm going to say you didn't read it either.  Even Fox New is turning on him  a little.  Just wait Dizz
2019-05-03, Until the government starts censoring your speech calm down sweetie.
2019-05-03, It's a travesty. They took Farrakhan off Facebook as a token  to make it appear it was not all conservatives BlackListedWhy can't people be allowed to speak the Truth anymore? Instead the radical democrat globalists want to force propaganda and starve citizens of truth.
2019-05-03, Fighting for a conspiracy theory nut job is an interesting strategy. Freedom of speech doesn't require access to all platforms. Newspapers are NOT constitutionally bround to print every individuals speeches nor are tv stations required to give everyone equal air time.
2019-05-03, Difference one is a business one is a platform. That means that they have to follow different rules. One you have full control over what is allowed the other you have no controls whatsover.
2019-05-03, Facebook is a business though.....which is why it has employees and makes a profit because it's a business. They are not mutually exclusive.
2019-05-03, Mr President I think AG Barr did a great job representing you on Wednesday! I hope my attorney Fred was watching because Barr put on a clinic demonstrating deception and distraction. FRED'S BEST COURTROOM TACTIC IS REMOVING HIS GLASS EYE TO SICKEN THE JURY!
2019-05-03, The clinic was put on by @SenKamalaHarris!
2019-05-03, Seriously you're trying to pass yourself off as a defender of Free Speech? He who has epic Twitter tantrums when others express their right. You're mad your fellow white supremacists were banned for violating TOS.  You aren't the defender of anything esp the 1st Amendment.
2019-05-03, I feel as though there is utter chaos in the White House. Truth is not truth. Laws are not laws.when you have to question the allegiance of your attorney general and of your president-something is very wrong

2019-05-03, I see you understand freedom of speech  as well as you understand most things.
2019-05-03, Trump is either stupid to think the 1st Amendment covers Facebook or he thinks his base is stupid.Or both.

2019-05-05, I desperately want him removed from office but I think an acquittal in the senate would be a net positive for Trump. The unfortunate reality is that we have to consider the politics. If we lose the house and they nuke the filibuster then we have no protection from their agenda
2019-05-05, i love stollen
2019-05-05, That will NEVER happen!!!
2019-05-05, You're riding the Obama horse with the economy. You did absolutely NOTHING to create this. Obama entered the WH on a huge downer economy & fixed it. You've failed all the way around again.
2019-05-05, They all seem to have graduated from The Hollywood Academy with a degree in political science.
2019-05-05, Comey's FBI sent undercover agents to spy on @realDonaldTrump's campaign.It's a stunning revelation of the lengths the Obama administration went.Instead of a phony Russia collusion investigation we actually need to investigate how this whole hoax started.

2019-05-06, The most glaring example in my mind is what happened in Wisconsin.  Democrats spent millions litigating against our policies while simultaneously working to elect radical left-wing activists to our state Supreme Court.
2019-05-06, Would love if one state ONE STATE actually had a radical left wing activist judge at any level of judge much less a state Supreme Court.  Projection of the right wing is amazing.  And yes the right wing is the one who appoints radical activist judges.  That is quantifiable.

2019-05-06, If Obama had not left the US in such a bad state there would never have been as much room for growth by Trump over the past 29 months. So you can technically say Obama is responsible but thank goodness for Trump and his ability to correct Obama's deficiencies. MAGA KAG2020

2019-05-22, It's not just for golfing anymore!?
2019-05-22, You are probably the greatest liar in this country's history as well as one of the most ignorant. Yes it is possible for both chambers to investigate AND legislate at the same time. It actually DOES work that way. These aren't games although you seem to act like they are.
2019-05-22, I disagree with what the House of Representatives is doing. I thought Mueller was the Final Word.  I can understand how the president feels   It's. Never. Enough.
2019-05-22, The United States Senate fully backs & supports President as does the people.  History will show this is a smelly pile of Democrats  which is stinking throughout the land having lefties in the MSM attacking doesn't prove a thing...American Citizens voted for @realDonaldTrump
2019-05-22, Democrats are working.  McConell is not letting bills thru to be debated or voted on.  You walked out on an infrastructure meeting 'cause your feelings were hurt.  And then you will go golfing.  Sounds like the republicans can't get anything done.
2019-05-22, Haha.  His investigation will lock up Obama team this time around. Wait your turn!
2019-05-22, Actually senators can eat and chew gum at the same time. Nevertheless I'm inclined to agree with @SpeakerPelosi not to pursue impeachment at this time. It's much more entertaining watching @realDonaldTrump self implode before our eyes every day.
2019-05-22, THANKS TEE!! 
2019-05-22, Mr. Trump stumbled on tosomething good - we needa two-dollar bill again now asnothing can be bought forunder one dollar and there'd be billions more two-dollar bills printed thantwenties - putting Ms Tubman's portrait is very wide circulation!@realDonaldTrump

2019-05-23, You're 100% correct!! Nobody is perfect but at least Obama didn't try to rip up the fabric of our democracy and economy; he actually did save it.
2019-05-23, Please Please Please vote all the Bad Dems out of office on 2020. Pelosi will be out of her job at that point and we can hopefully have a great next 4 years. The first were tough for DT but he sure is giving it his all!!! VOTE DEMS OUT!!

2019-06-07, Dear @realDonaldTrumpI heard today you used your "great brain" which apparently is part of Uranus to inform the American people that the Moon is part of Mars. Did Pluto tell you that or was it Mickey Mouse? I hear Jupiter is part of Florida. Maybe we could go there first.
2019-06-07, Ok Deep State. I don't know how old you are but I literally watched the second plane hit the second tower. Live. If you want anyone to take you seriously stop with this mess.
2019-06-07, Nah. He's just dumb.
2019-06-07, That's because ur fucking with the markets. You want tariffs. People start selling. Then you want a deal. Rich ppl buy back in. Then you'll break the deal.  Markets will tank. And it starts all over. It's called market manipulation & its 1 of 1000 things you should be in jail for
2019-06-07, We have to track down his brokers. This is so obvious.
2019-06-07, Going back to the moon THEN MARS. Obviously he means focusing on Mars also involves the moon and that we should not be focused SOLELY on the moon. Nit picky grammar nazis.

2019-06-07, Why should trump take that measly 400 K when he's making millions off the Trump Hotel.  And fact check. He hasn't actually given them the money yet.
2019-06-07, Good luck escalating the trade war with China. Someone is ready to fire the 1.3 trillion gun at the worst possible moment.
2019-06-07, I think he was fairly clear to anyone with above a 2nd grade comprehension skill that he was saying we will get to Mars by using the Moon and that going to the Moon should not be the end goal.
2019-06-07, Sorry haven't been paying attention to the list of NASA programs so of course I read it as he was saying that the Moon is a part of Mars. Don't blame me if Drumpf can't express himself clearly.
2019-06-07, Are you talking about Mars bars and Moon Pies dotard?
2019-06-07, Bro I thought it totally and completely exonerated you... not sure it can be both so which is it?
2019-06-07, Thank you for your service @jvharris65. @realDonaldTrump is such a spoiled rich lowlife he thinks one gets out of a war by not being a fan of it. Or getting daddy to pay for fake bone spur diagnoses.

2019-06-07, Yes. Americans need to wake up and never vote Democrat again.
2019-06-07, I've said that once @realDonaldTrump has no respect for an opponent he gives them a brand...until this week he had NOT branded Pelosi. "Nervous Nancy"  overplayed her hand now she has a brand.  She'll regret it.  Ask Hillary Ted Marco Jeb Chuck et al.
2019-06-07, Lock her up amirite? Banana Republicans started with you and will end with your lot in 2020.
2019-06-07, Now that @realDonaldTrump is stateside a few thoughts:1) Using the American Cemetery in Normandy as a backdrop to attack @SpeakerPelosi is a new low even for him.2) Bette Midler?3) This should have been a time to honor WWII heroes. Instead he made it all about himself.
2019-06-07, You missed him calling Robert Mueller -a decorated Vietnam Vet -names while he a draft dodger sat in a military cemetery

2019-06-07, Awesome. The fact that this man got sentenced to life for drugs is absolutely ridiculous. Waste of taxpayer money too.
2019-06-07, Yep!  Stock market still okay because Treasure might be making moves.  But he's made himself and his cronies more money by manipulating the market.
2019-06-07, There is no question that his cronies and others are manipulating the market to make it look like the economy is doing well. But remove the 1% from the indicators and you will see that we are in a deep recession.
2019-06-07, We can.
2019-06-07, Pheeeww! Good to get that cleared up Mr President because I thought the moon was a part of Uranus.
2019-06-07, Resign.
2019-06-07, Trump idolizes authoritarians and dictators.He condemns the laws of his own country that prevent him from being one himself.
2019-06-07, He's not bright or organized enough to change the US system fully to totalitarianism. The risk is who follows him. That US democracy still exists only because of the stupidity of the right is a sad thought though.

2019-06-09, BS. You hate your country. That's why you refuse to solve the open border problem. We are all on to you.
2019-06-09, That's why it was imperative that no one should know what he was *really* worth before he took office. So that we'd have no way of knowing how much he stole while in office.
2019-06-09, That's one of many reasons. The others include mortgage fraud bank fraud tax fraud tax evasion and money laundering.

2019-06-10, I think watching how Trump behaves as he's impeached by the House would be a learning experience for many Americans. Trump's narcissistic ego will not be able to handle it and he will show his supporters just how ugly and out of control he can get.

2019-06-16, Why @SpeakerPelosi is holding the line against impeaching @realDonaldTrump. My colleagues and I interviewed 15 frontline  (endangered) centrist Democrats   mostly freshmen who flipped GOP seats. Just one favors opening an impeachment inquiry.Liberals Want Trump Impeached but Centrist Freshmen May Have the Final Say (Published 2019)The president outrages the Democratic base daily but the lawmakers who gave Democrats their House majority remain firm that impeachment is not what their constituents want.nytimes.com
2019-06-16, imagine how much further they could go if they discovered the courage to stand up for democracy instead of holding seats they actually don't deserve if they let this republic fall 
2019-06-16, I'm curious about how many of the prominent conservatives who have been continually tweet raging about @realDonaldTrump are prepared to call on fellow Republicans to support endorse and vote for the Democratic nominee in 2020.
2019-06-16, It depends on who the nominee is. Which raises the question how many Democrats have learned the lesson of 2016 and will call on Dem candidates to moderate and appeal to more Americans to win in 2020? It feels like Dems could do a smidge more soul searching after losing to Trump.

2019-06-16, Is this your full life now? Paranoia panic and tweeting? I hope so. Sounds brutal.

2019-06-16, I 'll think about your opinion but why fail to state that speaker of the house Newt Gingrich had to resign bc of a sex scandal.  Now she's his wife but Trump found it appropriate to make her Ambassador to the Vatican .  In fact all 3 (R) speakers dur Clinton had sex scandals!

It was a total far exceeding @realDonaldTrump & all other presidents combined thus earning him title of DeporterInChief Isn't it time we fixed this rather than finger-pointed?Quote TweetGeraldo Rivera@GeraldoRivera · Jun 24 2019Unless Democrats are working to improve conditions for families along the border they should just shut up. Isn't there any decency-any desire- to just do the right thing for these vulnerable migrants? Instead we use inflammatory language with no meaningful talks on compromise.

2019-06-26, They thought the "manufactured crisis" at the border was a winning issue. But Trump slowed the illegal entries to a trickle without Congress. He got Mexico to help deter the illegal flow. Now Democrats are panicking. Trump fixed it without them.

2019-07-11, Barr also lied when he said that the media made up the story that Trump was considering adding the citizenship question by executive order but Trump said it when he was running his mouth before he left the WH last week.  They act like we have very short memories!
2019-07-11, They KNOW his supporters have the attention span of a goldfish aided by the 24 hour news cycle. Whatever idiocy @realDonaldTrump comes out with is eclipsed by the next one in a matter of hours so there's no point in remembering. It's all contrived that way.

2019-07-11, This tweet is not from Donald. He already let everyone know his philosophy on the subject. If he had his way he'd silence the free press and punish anyone who dared to criticize him. America is getting very weary of Trump and his never-ending chaotic sh*show.

2019-07-14, I'm so glad you were able to interpret that Trump didn't mean what he wrote. That's a pretty cool superpower.   Or if it's not that maybe you should realize that twisting your mind into a pretzel to defend a racist isn't a good look.

2019-07-16, Yup and he did say COME BACK.
2019-07-16, Tonight's disapproval resolution serves no one and fixes nothing. It divides our nation and distracts us from addressing the issues the American people sent us here to solve. It's time House Democrats start focusing on the real problems facing Americans instead of their own.

2019-07-24, The spin from Donald Trump and his allies is that the MuellerHearing was a disaster.  The only disaster was 2016 when Russia attacked our democracy & t/ Trump campaign openly welcomed that attack. Since then Mr. Trump as Mr. Mueller testified today has obstructed the truth.
2019-07-24, What the American people got was:The president is not exonerated. There were multiple attempts by the president to obstruct justice. The president could be charged with obstruction of justice after leaving office. TrumpIsAFelon

2019-07-24, Much as I hate to say it this morning's hearing was a disaster. Far from breathing life into his damning report the tired Robert Mueller sucked the life out of it. The effort to save democracy and the rule of law from this lawless president has been set back not advanced.
2019-07-24, He's lawless because he's trying to turn this country around and back up its founding principles  trying to repair the damage done by leftists like you who want to tear our patriotisma nd culture to shreds. Thank heavens for @realDonaldTrump MAGA2020!!

2019-07-25, Wow that is harsh but unfortunately too true.trump believes people are stupid enough to think he cares about African-Americans simply because he champions the cause of one celebrity. trump is the one who thinks there are fine people in the white supremacist movement

2019-07-26, Wait ... I thought Mexico was paying for the wall. We're taking funds from our military?baitandswitch
2019-07-26, all these took place before joy villa was on the payroll.

2019-07-26, A Monarch wouldn't have waited for a Supreme Court ruling.It's concerning that you wouldn't have a grasp of that fact.POTUS didn't steal.But lets talk about the tax structure & how YOUR policies hurt the poor.YOU steal from the poor & assure they can never accumulate wealth
2019-07-26, Biden Warren Bernie and Kamala have ALL pledged to repeal @realDonaldTrump's tax cuts if elected.Here's what that really means:*higher utility bills*lower pay*fewer jobsWe can't afford their socialist policies!
2019-07-26, Hysterical.  The tax cut didn't lower my utility bills. It didn't result in employers paying higher wages just because. It didn't result in job creation. Consumer demand not billions in 1% coffers drives job creation.
2019-07-26, President Trump accomplished this and much more despite fighting off a horde of DemonRats MSM Hate Trumpers Resistance corporate and Rich and Powerful Hollyweird Globalists as well as a throng of RINO's. President Trump is truly a great and amazing President.
2019-07-26, Apparently you are wrong now that you've been overruled by the other two branches of government. Checks and balances my dear just as the founders designed it.
2019-07-26, The President's primary duty is to protect US citizens. Perhaps if YOU loved America like HE does you would see the importance of building the wall to protect our country.

2019-07-26, Lawfully ?
2019-07-26, We are intensifying efforts to hold @realDonaldTrump accountable as we move forward with our investigation. Today we made clear to the court that we are considering impeachment along with other options under Article I powers. No one is above the law.

2019-07-28, You're a traitor to yourself and the country. Coward.
2019-07-28, And the constituents blame it on anyone but who they voted in. And they'll keep voting them back in with no change in their districts and states. And blame states that are doing better for their problems. 
2019-07-28, Let's hope this will be the election that changes things. We've never been this close to losing it all. Sometimes it takes a crisis to shake people up. I'm praying anyway.
2019-07-28, Demokkkrats willfully root for impeachment because Obama's overarching plan is still at work: divide America until we can no longer be united.  Impeachment fits right in with the plan.  Barack Obama - The Great Divider.

2019-07-28, In the last 2 years @realDonaldTrump has:- created jobs- lowered taxes- strengthened border security - improved veteran care Democrats have:- talked about Russia- investigated about Russia - held hearing after hearing about Russia How embarrassing.

2019-08-04, When President @realDonaldTrump spends more time and energy denouncing Rep. Elijah Cummings and Baltimore than he does denouncing right-wing extremists who often traffic in hate and white nationalism it shows his priorities are un-American and way off balance.

2019-08-04, The shooters re-tweet the tweets of @realDonaldTrump; and they seem to surf the same parts of the Great White Web.GunViolence is contagious. An American epidemic of GunViolence is underway. Solutions exist we have the resolve to pursue them.
2019-08-04, This was so predictable. Hate speech by POTUS to low IQ individuals = violence against minorities. Not a surprise.
2019-08-04, First racism belongs at the foot of those who base their value of others on the color of their skin and talk about it constantly. Second these attacks are just a symptom of the disease in America today the rejection of God and His values which founded this nation.

2019-08-05, Here's more perspective from Larry Elder.
2019-08-05, That the @realDonaldTrump I'm familiar with.
2019-08-05, Republicans are spineless. Shame on @realDonaldTrump and @DanCrenshawTX for supporting gun control. The actions of others don't determine my rights and you're stabbing your voters in the back. Don't expect to be re-elected if you want your voters to be left defenseless.
2019-08-05, Win win for the rest of us.. gun control and Trump out of office.
2019-08-05, Shut your mouth.Trump's rally in El Paso demonized immigrants and Hispanics. Patrick Crusius manifesto repeated Trump's beliefs. He targeted Hispanics.You are an architect of hate and division.I would examine my own soul if I were you.God is watching you.
2019-08-05, Guys Trump can read a script. But he is a still a proven racist. At this point the only way to describe his words is like this. Our President who is a racist and fans the flames of hate said the following..
2019-08-05, Not even sure about imbecile @realDonaldTrump's ability to read... Toledo?
2019-08-05, How exactly would your brand of immigration reform have prevented these terrorist attacks? Both were US born citizens. One based his manifesto on your public words.

2019-08-05, Almost nobody gets their guns back once taken.  Counselors and Courts are risk adverse.  They always keep the guns and don't return them.  I worked at a county courthouse before becoming a nurse. Saw it multiple times.  Never saw a gun returned. If it's happened not often.
2019-08-05, I've also seen guys wives get a Order of Harassment or Order of Protection without evidence during a divorce to keep kids. Dad must give up guns.  Judge said he'd issue it to be on the safe side.  Some got guns back as they went to relatives instead of police. Depends on state.

2019-08-05, What are you? 12? Get a clue.
2019-08-05, The democrats are losing the illegal immigration issue in court of public opinion. They will pay for it in 2020 elections. It is both dumb and political suicide to tie immigration legislation to legislation that blatantly restricts the exercise of a Constitutional right.

2019-08-06, I learned to drive on farms tractors trucks cars. Senator Booker is try to force his Anti-Gun RELIGION onto the People!!
2019-08-06, Your entire statement is full of half truths misconceptions exaggerations bald faced lies & just plain meanness. If this weren't such a serious issue I would applaud your work ethic.  The people of El Paso live their lives together in harmony.  Right now YOU are their problem.
2019-08-06, Tell that to Heather Heyer. Tell that to the victims at Christchurch or El Paso. Tell that to the victims of the increased number of hate crimes by people emboldened by that man.
2019-08-06, US counties where President Donald Trump held a campaign rally saw a 226% increase in reported hate crimes compared to similar counties that did not hold a rally political scientists at the University of North Texas said in aWashington Post analysis.
2019-08-06, Son can you at least create an actual account instead of being such a colossal wimp with this itsme47481648582647 nonsense? Just stop being so scared about everything ever. jfc
2019-08-06, Oh you call yourself a press secretary? Why tomorrow? No golf scheduled? The citizens asked him not to come. He should respect their words and grief.
2019-08-06, @realDonaldTrump doesn't respect anything or anybody why would he change now? Not accepted into "high society" like he desperately craved he now wreaks hell and havoc on the world. No class no sense no manners no decorum. LoserOfTheFreeWorld
2019-08-06, AWESOMEThanks to @JoaquinCastroTX for FOLLOWING THE MONEY of who is supporting @realDonaldTrump's campaign. All Americans should know who is funding Trump because by funding him they are funding his racism.RacistInChief
2019-08-06, Yes and so far I haven't seen it said better than Joe Scarborough @Morning_Joe yesterday.Quote TweetMorning Joe@Morning_Joe · Aug 5 2019"For those of you funding Donald Trump's re-election campaign you may want to take note: Because you keep writing checks to this president it's on you...because you are funding this white supremacist campaign...It is your money that is funding this white supremacy." --@JoeNBC
2019-08-06, Imagine the outrage if emails from your political opponent were hacked & released by Wikileaks during the 2016 campaign and the Rethuglicans capitalized on that then claimed ignorance.
2019-08-06, Would be nice if McCabe Comey and other's fired or forced out actually brought a class action suit for wrongful termination defamation and a host of other horrors bestowed on them and include trump in the suit.
2019-08-06, Meanwhile nothing is done for the people that pay taxes ! We are the only developed country that is so far behind on lots of things ! HC maternity leave pay raises more vacation time etc! GOP doesn't have the problems we do so they just ignore them !
2019-08-06, You going anywhere just turns into a hate rally and costs a damn fortune to the communities you visit and do not pay back. Not a great idea.
2019-08-06, Regimes reign Traitor. US presidents serve. Don't get it twisted.
2019-08-06, Don't you have a public position funded by taxpayers? Maybe use your work time get the names correct before tweeting. It was Joaquin Castro and the information is publicly available. If you want to be an anonymous donor you can do that too. 
2019-08-06, Oh sorry I see now you "abruptly resigned" over "rumored tension"
2019-08-06, I got twitmoed yesterday for having the nerve to correct someone for posting that these RWNJs were actually  lefties'.. ..it may have been my approach though telling them to fuck off and die etc..
2019-08-06, It is precisely bold and the kind of moral leadership that your country is so sadly lacking under Trump.
2019-08-06, I'd people are proud of donating to Trump what's the problem? I'll tell you exactly who I've donated to.
2019-08-06, Build the wall
2019-08-06, What a jealous small person you are. You can't handle that the person you're the most jealous of in the whole world is loved and respected by people all over the world. You will *never* have that.
2019-08-06, NE VER.
2019-08-07, Oh a Q  believer. Now *there's* someone to look to for sane accurate commentary.
2019-08-06, Democrat leaders hate @realDonaldTrump's supporters so much they're now doxxing them.Imagine the media outrage if Republicans did this.Joaquin Castro Posts Names Employers Of Trump DonorsJoaquin Castro posted the names and employers of 44 San Antonio residents who donated the federal maximum to President Donald Trump's reelection campaign.dailycaller.com
2019-08-07, Where the hell have you been?  Trump and DJTJ made ample use of STOLEN documents that their friends published....you don't get to do that and then whine when someone publishes perfectly legal information that is in the public domain...
2019-08-07, Nice lie Ronna. The list he posted is all PUBLIC information. somanylies Also Daily Caller link 
2019-08-07, Why does the president of our great country get invoved in such petty bantor? The only explanation is that the president is petty!
2019-08-07, Because the Dayton shooter didn't write a manifesto quoting Warren.Also because unlike WhiteSupremacistInChief @realDonaldTrump Warren doesn't lock brown children in concentration camps or call Mexicans murderers & rapists or talk about immigrants infesting our country.Duh
2019-08-07, The El Paso killer no more represents the Republican Party than the Dayton killer represents the Democratic party. The liberals running for President should answer @realDonaldTrump's call to unite and work together instead of politicizing these evil acts of terrorism.
2019-08-07, You represent Donald Trump and you are responsible for putting his lies out there for over 2.5 years. The loss of life is far more important that your cheap rhetoric. If you can't grasp that then you are more devoid of decency than previously thought which is lower than low.
2019-08-07, Just watched Joe Biden give an AMAZING speech slamming Trump with absolute clarity saying this "president has fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation.  And that Trump "has more in common with George Wallace than George Washington."
2019-08-07, Joe Biden can string a sentence together which is more than we can say about Trump. Trump wants to threaten us with how bad we will be with someone else. I  for one  am looking forward to anything that lets me know I'm not living in a dystopian society anymore
2019-08-07, It's sad you would respect this man when he has no respect for us.  Trump will NOT be re-elected
2019-08-07, Um...yes he will!
2019-08-07, The media only reports on narratives that will benefit them. The Dayton shooter was a liberal who supported the radical left group ANTIFA. This does not support the liberal media's agenda hence the lack of reporting on it.
2019-08-07, Idiot. If Connor Betts' actions were informed by his beliefs you'd have a case. EWarren rails against Republican bankers and their causing family bankruptcies. If Betts went to the club district in Dayton to mow down GOP bankers or Wall St. execs he picked the wrong venue.
2019-08-07, I'm from Ohio Ohioans should be pissed with Dayton Mayor and Senator Sharrod Brown. Disrespect the President and the victims and family members. Ohioans show our displeasure.
2019-08-07, How'd they disrespect them? They didn't worship him? They asked questions the entire country needs answers too and we are sick of waiting for this mockery in DC to end.
2019-08-07, PROPAGANDA ALERT: The journalists traveling with @realDonaldTrump were not allowed to go into the hospital with him. Any video of the event released by the White House will need to be viewed with extreme skepticism as it will have been stage managed to make POTUS look good.Quote TweetDan Scavino Jr. Archived@Scavino45 · Aug 7 2019..The President was treated like a Rock Star inside the hospital which was all caught on video.

2019-08-07, The people in the hospital propaganda video were all crisis actors
2019-08-07, It is not illegal to seek asylum.  He has referred to these refugees as invaders and he has a long long history of bigoted statements.
2019-08-07, Really a visit to towns that had tragedies and all you care about is their response to you. What a narcissist asshole .
2019-08-07, it's amazing how uneducated people use the phrase  "assault weapons" and think they know what they're talking about
2019-08-07, I don't think he cares about them either. He just makes them think he does and they are stupid enough to believe him.
2019-08-07, Thank God May has gone many breathe a sigh of relief!
2019-08-07, Thank you President Trump for representing this country with nothing but class and dignity!God Bless the people of Dayton and El Paso!
2019-08-07, Class? Dignity? Where?
2019-08-07, Can you act presidential for just one day? Is that possible?
2019-08-07, Nope. He cannot.
2019-08-07, Joaquin Castro is targeting @realDonaldTrump's supporters for simply exercising their right to free speech.It's a dangerous precedent for any politician to set. Why won't 2020 Democrats condemn it?
2019-08-07, Maybe because it's a matter of public record? I'm not ashamed for anyone to see who I give money to. It's @PeteButtigieg  See? I'm proud of mine and I don't care who knows it.
2019-08-07, President @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS met with survivors family members and hospital staff in Dayton Ohio today.
2019-08-07, He made a Propaganda film. Instead of a solemn occasion it was turned into this unprofessional film set to music. Shameful. Embarrassing.
2019-08-07, Encouraging remarks from @realDonaldTrump this AM. @Sen_JoeManchin & I are working w/ colleagues & the White House to pass our bipartisan bill that will extend background checks to better keep guns away from felons/mentally ill while protecting 2A rights of law abiding citizens.Quote TweetAxios@axios · Aug 7 2019Trump: "There's a great appetite and I mean a very strong appetite for background checks. And I think we can bring up background checks like we've never had before."
2019-08-07, Or you could just ask Mitch to put the two House bills up for a vote along with the election security bill.
2019-08-07, You can show them ALL the facts in the World! You can show them videos where he says things they say he hasn't with him being interviewed saying them & they will STILL deny it! SCARY the American people are that easily brain washed isn't it!
2019-08-07, Unlike you we are smart enough to understand context.
2019-08-07, WTF is this? At least 31 killed in US weekend mass shootings & Trump is talking about the surviving victims in the hospital showing so much love & respect for the office of presidency?

2019-08-07, everyone hates you no one is voting for you and literally none of my friends who live in maxine's district have heard of you. take your ball and go home before you make a bigger fool of yourself than you already have.
2019-08-07, I had to close my motorbike shop up when the economy tanked. I am now ready to start anew since Trump's policies have improved the economic climate. He has been up front from the start and things are good here. The Democrats like Labour over there...
2019-08-07, You mean Obama's policies that saved the economy?
2019-08-07, Wow that explains it it was hippy era... acid didn't do the brain any good.
2019-08-07, LSD has effects that last for years she's proving it now.
2019-08-08, Twitter censorship got me like:
2019-08-08, Yes the phenom of the angry Christian always puzzled me. Isn't faith supposed to comfort people? Give them peace & serenity. Some of these Pastors are so miserable.
2019-08-08, I use to work retail in my area and every Sunday when the Christians came out of church and into the store they were always angry and nasty. Could never understand it
2019-08-08, He actually talked about crowd size while at the hospital.  No class. No decorum.  Embarrassingly self centered.  Weak. Impotent. Fake leader
2019-08-08, I'm a Christian and I find this heart wrenching! And I will never vote for Trump. NEVER!
2019-08-08, I'm a Christian also and I did not and will not vote for him either!!!!!!!!!!!
2019-08-08, Nobody has asked.Nobody cares.He should serve his sentence.
2019-08-08, And here legally...
2019-08-08, Blagojevich was sentenced for corruption charges.  Nevermind....this is you who we're dealing with.  This doesn't surprise me.
2019-08-08, Or will you pull another HRC and it will all be just talk?
2019-08-08, He's a crooked politician who also appeared on your game show. Not surprised you want to cut him a break. And spare us the narrative. You've already decided to commute his sentence. We've seen this dog and pony show before.

2019-08-08, Thank you President Trump for continuing to make us proud each and every day. Keep it up!

2019-08-08, He seems angry about something but GOD put this Mute feature on my phone so idk...

2019-08-08, Sounds about right! Well done!

2019-08-08, Well Said ! Totally AGREE !!!!
2019-08-08, Dan Coats and Sue Gordon were the only grownups left. They left because they saw their job as serving our nation while Trump felt their job was serving him. He ignored U.S. intelligence going against it and siding with despots like Putin and Kim Jong-un. We are so screwed.

2019-08-09, Does that mean you can afford to pay El Paso for your Rally and Washington DC for your Inauguration Probably no - what a Flake 
2019-08-09, NO RED FLAG LAWS @realDonaldTrump If someone anyone calls in a red flag just like Ppl call in swatting & if you own guns & they are legal in your home it can still cost you lawyer fees & court fees to get them back. It could take up to a year in some cases. I would be pissed
2019-08-09, I would suggest anyone who doesn't have a Concealed Carry Permit to get one. There may be a chance of special conditions written into laws. My state you can carry W/O but I always keep in mind of Fed Laws.

2019-08-09, Might want to actually listen to the video and read the transcripts.  Then maybe talk about it.  You know he wasn't referring to the white supremacists or antifa as being fine people but sure your narrative
2019-08-09, We get it Ronna. Trump does something unbelievable we react appropriately and you say we're the problem. Got it. Your tactics are showing. Yawn.
2019-08-09, Cruelty? You mean like when Democrats tell millions of women to abort millions of babies because babies are not "human"? THAT kind of cruelty?

2019-08-09, Free speech works both ways. People are free to donate to the candidate of their choice and speak out about if they so choose. But people are also free to speak or write who those donors are especially when that info is already public information.

2019-08-09, We won't get a socialist elected @mitchellvii . It is idiots like you Bill that will get socialists elected by defending the attack on the 2nd Amendment by @realDonaldTrump . He betrayed his campaign promises. My allegiance is to the Constitution not one man unlike you..

2019-08-16, The most important element of the story is the fact that two American congresswomen shunned a bipartisan congressional delegation to Israel to go on an independent trip to Israel sponsored by vicious anti-Semites. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib Partnered with Vicious Anti-Semites to Plan Their Trip to IsraelThis should be a national scandal.nationalreview.com
2019-08-16, French gets a big part wrong. @IsraeliPM and @realDonaldTrump did not ban the Palestinian Pals. Israeli LAW did. Bibi and Trump merely supported the ban.Anyone who advocates BDS against Israel by Israeli law are denied entry. Omar/Talib are vocal supporters of BDS.

2019-08-20, Planned Parenthood could easily have kept its funding if it was simply willing to stop murdering babies.  The fact that it was not shows that their main focus is not women's healthcare but is in fact abortion.

2019-08-26, Fair enough as does extreme misogynistic behavior....the latter only in our purview when Sharia Law is attempted in the US. Countries force 11yr old girls marry 70yr old men. Sadly we have to deal with some of these but Clinton Foundation takes $$$ from them and has a choice
2019-08-26, While six world leaders came together to take action & decide on a $20 million aid package to fight the Amazon fires President @realDonaldTrump skipped the meeting.

2019-08-27, What about Trump ordering  American companies to stop manufacturing goods in China. Isn't that controlling production? Does that mean Ivanka will have to stop having her clothing and shoe lines made in China?

2019-08-27, I've been trying not to buy anything for Chinese for years. All you have to do is look at how many Chinese product recalls there have been to know they want to poison us or watch us burn.
2019-08-27, The mainstream media has clearly become the enemy of the people. Bunch of liars.
2019-08-27, The country is way out of control when the President of the United States goes on Twitter whining about everything and anything rather then shutting up and just not tweet and ACTUALLY DO WHAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DOES AND THAT IS ACTUAL WORK
2019-08-27, Axios is a favorite of RINO's and Fox News. Jonathan Swan is a key contributor and he is a completely obnoxious personality who thinks he knows all. @axios

2019-08-27, Spend a week tweeting only verifiable information on your successful policies. I dare you.
2019-08-27, Too much accusing with no evidence whatsoever. It's harmful & TP has already had one suicide because of it.. That's more than enough. Caution required.
2019-08-27, Guys I am stuck here in this thread forever by mistake! So I cannot stay still here and need to do my thing. And that is promote Andrew Yang! 
2019-08-27, Yang is a bad meme.
2019-08-27, This is a doctored video!
2019-08-27, According to one source who was there.  What source? Who was there? You are reporting this as fact when you have no evidence for it. This isn't reporting it's starting a baseless rumour about @realDonaldTrump because you don't like him
2019-08-27, One of the meetings was transcribed and confirmed Trump's comments!

2019-08-28, 60 miles of border fencing have gone up under your tenure and...they were all approved by the Obama administration. This mythical wall  you speak of does not exist never has existed and never will exist. It's a complete con like you and your Presidency.
2019-08-28, EXACTLY  Trump and Potus  is just show prototypes of what was to be build and to this date has not been built  same as @POTUS breathed a sigh of relief when Epstein took his own life (sad he did no courage)   Even Fox news has left @POTUS today  wonder why
2019-08-28, President @realDonaldTrump has signed the largest increase in our national defense in decades. The Army will have nearly 300 new M1 Abrams Tanks the Navy will deploy the most advanced class of aircraft carriers in history & the Air Force will have hundreds of brand new F-35s!
2019-08-28, Well no wonder you are now talking about cutting Medicare Medicaid and Social Security.
2019-08-28, Under the leadership of President @realDonaldTrump America is more prosperous our military is stronger and our veterans are getting the care and respect they deserve! Our Administration will ALWAYS stand with the amazing men and women of our Armed Forces.

2019-08-28, I saw the footage of you arriving in New York was surprised that .@realDonaldTrump wasn't there to greet you I mean he is such an environmentalist so much so that he thinks ClimateChange is a niche issue !!!
2019-08-28, So much of environmentalist he didn't even attend the g7 meeting about ClimateChange I assume that is because he knew everything anyway..not because he just had a diary malfunction. Perhaps that was his version of a ClimateStrikeTrump says he's 'an environmentalist' after skipping G-7 climatePresident Trump on Monday touted his environmentalist credentials hours after skipping a Group of Seven (G-7) summit meeting focused on climate oceans and biodiversity.thehill.com
2019-08-28, Freedom of religion also means freedom from religion

2019-08-28,  Potential Trump Lawsuit Against Lawrence O'Donnell Could  Backfire' by Making Deutsche Bank Docs Part of Discovery'What you seem to be really afraid of is your tax returns getting out.
2019-08-28, The only problem here is that Lawrence repeatedly stated that "if true". Not once did he claim these were facts.
2019-08-28, Trying to even deal with it now feels like suddenly living inside some kind of Doonesbury storyline or a MAD Magazine parody It shocks me every day that this is even real.
2019-08-28, WAIT WAIT WAIT... Of all the things said about Donald Trump in his presidency and THIS is the first demand of such?So either this is completely true or all other accusations are true.
2019-08-28, Disgraceful. You owe an apology to @realDonaldTrump and he should bring you to court for this lie.
2019-08-28, I'm gonna go out in a limb and guess you know very little about libel/slander law. Of Trump sued he would have to prove the falsity of the statement. Which would mean O Donnell would get discovery of Trump baking/loan records. I seriously doubt DJT wants that.
2019-08-28, Don't you have a vacation to go on? One where there won't be internet access?
2019-08-28, This doesn't even make sense. You're claiming that Africans are going to Mexico to get non-existent free healthcare in US which has the most expensive healthcare in the world.  anybody that believes this would vote for a failed business man turned reality show host...
2019-08-28, LOL. he thinks we don't know that actually Kamala is the one he is afraid of.
2019-08-28, You should already have relief set up instead of tweeting.
2019-08-28, Computer-generated fake wall. Real fake President.
2019-08-28, Here is another totally stupid and ridiculous policy change by @realDonaldTrump. This change punishes US service members who deploy overseas to fight for our country. And it will make it even more difficult to recruit people to join our all volunteer military.Quote TweetHaley Britzky@halbritz · Aug 28 2019USCIS confirms: As of October 29 children born to U.S. service members outside of the U.S. will no longer be automatically considered citizens.Their parents will have to apply for citizenship on their behalf. https://taskandpurpose.com/childShow this thread
2019-08-28, Why do they not hold you accountable for spreading lies?The policy manual update today does not affect who is born a U.S. citizen period. It only affects children who were born outside the US and were not US citizens. This does NOT impact birthright citizenship.
2019-08-28, Welcome to New York @gretathunberg!The determination and perseverance shown during your journey should embolden all of us taking part in next month's ClimateAction Summit.We must deliver on the demands of people around the world and address the global climate crisis.

2019-08-28, I'm in Alabama very close to FL line. Still not sure how you can support a man that lies so much but I certainly wish you no harm in the storm.  Peace to you as well.
2019-08-28, Use shorter words.
2019-08-28, Agreed. The word "President" has THREE syllables. That's at least two too many syllables. Need to substitute a shorter word. I suggest "King".
2019-08-28, My God do you ever do any actual work? You have treated this entire presidency as just one long vacation. All you do is golf tweet or vacation at your properties. Try doing some actual work. But then again we are probably safer with you not working.
2019-08-28, Somebody want to tell this imbecile that pretty much the entire foundation of a working democracy is based on the principle that the news doesn't 'work for' the government?
2019-08-28, Just a heads up to everyone who called Obama the antichrist the Bible describes the antichrist as a conman who proclaims himself King of the Jews.
2019-08-28, It was a TAN suit! LET. IT. GO! ImpeachNow
2019-08-28, This man eh! 
2019-08-28, thankfully it missed Puerto Rico.. but with a little luck it can hit another totally corrupt coastal property... mar a lago.wipe it off the face of palm beach....it would be a great start.
2019-08-28, Its true in our political environment there's no way to get 2/3 of the Senate to convict @realDonaldTrump despite the evidence provided by the House. However impeachment should proceed to educate the nation & hold @SenateGOP accountable for abetting high crimes & misdemeanors
2019-08-29, "But the inspector general report found no evidence that Mr. Comey had lied during his interviews or that politics had influenced his efforts to prompt the appointment of a special counsel."

2019-08-29, Apparently. He can even steal money from FEMA during hurricane season for it.
2019-08-29, I FB all MAGAFollowing as many as i can
2019-08-29, Yet!! We have the Christians supporting @realDonaldTrump and they act like they are pro-life and supporting this monster?
2019-08-29, That's because they're "Christians" - they're a name-only brand. I feel sorry for those few quiet people who are actually true Christians - their religion has been co-opted by people filled with hate who use Christianity to market their hate. christofascists talibangelists
2019-08-29, All followed &rt
2019-08-29, The candidates for the 3rd Democratic debate are set and I don't know what pleases me more that all 10 of these Democrats have a combined ZERO percent chance of beating @realDonaldTrump or the fact that we will only have to sit through one night of the debate.
2019-08-29, Is that the same percent chance of Trump not lying for one day.
2019-08-29, What a lovely and regal couple.
2019-08-29, Will it be tremendously wet with water?
2019-08-29, You are so toxic that beating you in 2020 is not only important it is downright necessary
2019-08-29, This seems a tad inappropriate to put this on this post
2019-08-29, You could care less when it was headed to Puerto Rico but now that it is aiming for Mar a Lago-you are concerned. Will you claim more damage then it sustains again?
2019-08-29, Thank you Mr. President.

2019-08-29, We should just pray we do not end up with an anti-American antisemitic anti-rights pro-terrorism pro-abortion pro-illegal aliens over American citizens pro-sexual deviant pro-socialist President who values people based upon identity and not internal character.
2019-08-29, Every time a report comes out and nobody is held accountable we are told to wait till the next report come out. Lol. No one has been held accountable amongst the spy gate plotters as of today.
2019-08-29, We have a new thing called television.  On it theres plenty of weather reporting . So most are up to date with the latest news on the hurricane.  Maybe you could find more important things to do than a weather report .

2019-08-29, The party that booed God and practices infanticide has NO conscious. They justify hate violence killing and a lot more. Comey and his goons are proud.
2019-08-29, This is the best take they could get?
2019-08-29, He couldn't get anymore creative people? He didnt create a budget? They can show people on the ground? What an unprofessional White House.
2019-08-29, Sez the man who disgusts and is hated by the majority of Americans yet has no idea whatsoever what shame feels like.YOUR only reaction to any incident of being called out is anger.  There's a word for people like that.
2019-08-29, One of the most painful lessons I've learned was in 1996. There's no justice in this life.  If we hung everyone deserving there wouldn't be a bare tree branch in Washington. You know what's worse than death? Living with our mistakes. The republic may not survive because of Edu.
2019-08-29, I hope this is ironic
2019-08-29, Precious Pup! 
2019-08-29, I can practically smell all the desperation coming off of you through my phone  You're doing everything you can to seem relevant
2019-08-28, Give directly to @realDonaldTrump . Do NOT give to RNC.Their lack of effort cost us the house. Ronna is being rewarded for winning her State for Trump in 2016. She is not the right person for 2020. RNC are lazy $ wasting machines that will not change. DeepState pocket hoarders
2019-08-29, I don't trust @GOP too many RINOS. But @realDonaldTrump has to run on that ticket. Just how it is. Independents couldn't support or get him elected. That being said I'm Independent.
2019-08-29, Indeed! It's great to know we have a leader who responds quickly to any crisis! Well done President Trump!
2019-08-29, I'm sure after the hurricane he will respond quickly with plenty of paper towels
2019-08-29, Or how about you show me one week and 7 lies go ahead we'll wait
2019-08-29, Bet on it! No way a single random  hurricane will hit all three hot spots!
2019-08-29, What the hell was the point of that???
2019-08-29, This takes away a lot of the hype around the IG report. Looking at Yates' prior public testimony and after the fact classification decisions Comey is guilty of disclosing that Trump obstructed the Flynn investigation and wrote one word at the Confidential level. https://t.co/dGr8tqMFHxThis Tweet is unavailable.
2019-08-29, Reading @lawfareblog on IG report I'm darn grateful @Comey meticulously documented his interactions with @realDonaldTrump. In retrospect given Trump's documented 10k+ lies Comey is more than justified in keeping ol' fashioned CYA memos.
2019-08-29, This is embarrassing

2019-09-02, @realDonaldTrump Dude just admit when you make a mistake. Way easier than being so angry all the time.
2019-09-02, Nothing not even a massive hurricane is going to stop President Trump from playing golf.The president made a big show of how much attention he was going to pay to Hurricane Dorian. He said he was so focused on Dorian.Apparently focused  means golfing the entire weekend. 
2019-09-02, I just watched your whole 'sentence or statement".You of all people should NOT be encouraging anyone to do same. You should wish it into a void never to be seen or heard again pretty much like every 'sentence or statement' that you stammer through.
2019-09-02, If you were so concerned  you would get off the fucking golf course and do your fucking job. 
2019-09-02, Trump is by far and away the worse in history and it's not even close.
2019-09-02, Does Trump think he is using the Force thru his Tweets by trying to make us think we didn't actually see what he wrote yesterday. BTW the force only works on the weak minded...like republicans!
2019-09-02, What is that message exactly bud?Seems to me if the message is what you say it is most Trump rally members would not throw out like minded people. But that is just common sense.

2019-09-03, When @realDonaldTrump was elected president he promised to get us out of endless wars. He promised to stop spending trillions of dollars with the military industrial complex and put it into American infrastructure.  Mad dog Mattis and his cronies in the Pentagon don't like that.
2019-09-03, Of course starting on the day that Mr. Trump leaves the office that he has so completely dishonored degraded and disgraced he will also be liable to be criminally charged for everything from being a co-conspirator with Michael Cohen to tax evasion to obstruction of justice.

2019-09-18, First the military does not use the AR-15. They use "real" select fire weapons like an M16.Second every mass shooting thus far has been committed with a semi-auto firearm (no military weapons). Almost every gun today is semi-auto besides shotguns and single-shot rifles.
2019-09-18, This is the most asinine comment on the differences between an AR-15 and M-16 that I've ever seen. You also completely miss the point. We need the assault weapon ban and we need more movement on gun reform everything else is fluff.

2019-09-29, Makes you wonder what he knows is about to drop.My guess given the latest rants is that he knows there's another Whistleblower
2019-09-29, Lay this threat like all the others he has made at @realDonaldTrump's feet. That they are echoed by GOP Congressmen & hacks like Jordan & Miller amplifies the threats. This should be reason enough for Trump to be removed from office. Likewise his threats to @RepAdamSchiff.Quote TweetBrian Stelter@brianstelter · Sep 29 2019Scott Pelley on CBS just now: "@60Minutes has obtained a letter that indicates" the whistleblower "is under federal protection -- because he or she fears for their safety."

2019-10-21, I sincerely think @realDonaldTrump  has a huge problem with the words "ability" "preserve" "protect" and "defend"

2019-10-22, Agreed.  Encouraging pultecult members to harass veterans and veteran organzations.  Paying people to harass and incite violence against said people must end.
2019-10-22, LIEU just emerged and described Taylor's testimony as incredibly damaging to the president.  Wouldn't provide specifics. He said questioning of the witness has begun.
2019-10-22, How is the Biden campaign privy to and commenting on testimony that was supposedly conducted in secret. Are they assuming what was said or were they given privileged access or is it FakeNews?  @realDonaldTrump @RepTedLieu DrainTheSwamp MAGA2020

2019-10-22, The reps who are actually on the committees (D' & R's) are in there and you know it. The contempt you have for voters by lying to them so easily is disgusting. You lost 40 House seats & didn't learn a thing. Keep rearranging chairs on the Trump Titanic.

2019-10-22, Offended?
2019-10-22, He can say anything he wants. It's a free country and He's the President. Who cares what the crazy left redefines every day? Don't cave with polls insinuating it's right or wrong. Free speech is free and Constitutional.
2019-10-22, That is so true.
2019-10-22, If the President wishes to learn about actual lynching I would encourage him to read support & pass my bill the Emmett Till Antilynching Act which makes lynching a federal hate crime. Unfortunately for him there are no anti-impeachment sections. https://congress.gov/116/bills/hr35/BILLS-116hr35ih.pdf 
2019-10-22, If @realDonaldTrump is opposed to lynching he should intervene and stop the execution of RodneyReed an innocent black man on Texas Death Row framed by racist white cops for murder. The lynching is scheduled for Nov 20th.

2019-10-23, Schiff - Today Laura Cooper did her lawful duty & answered questions from both parties.She did so notwithstanding efforts by the President to stop her & when those failed efforts by his GOP allies in Congress to do the same.We will not be deterred from revealing the truth.

2019-10-23, It's simple. The American people deserve transparency yet House Democrats continue to ram through their impeachment investigation in secret and behind closed doors. What are the Democrats hiding about the impeachment inquiry? 
2019-10-23, Nothing is being hidden. They are following House rules. Bipartisan committee is holding hearings and will decide whether to impeach @POTUS based on the facts.

2019-10-27, There is no amount of dead Al-Bagdadis that will absolve @realDonaldTrump from the absolute disaster of his decision to pull American troops from Syria. One right does not fix a thousand wrongs. The only thing he did was to approve the operation. A monkey could have done that.

2019-10-27, Trump told the Russians before he told Congress about the Baghdadi raid. This morning he rambled for 45 minutes with an unverifiable tale and not one media outlet stopped him for facts. The co-dependent relationship he has with Putin and that the media has with him are killers.
2019-10-27, So everyone is questioning how the Occupant in the WH @realDonaldTrump could thank Russia before our own troops.Consider this the majority of loans he received from Deutsche Bank were co-signed by Russian oligarchs. In other words he is in debt to Russia. Russia owns him.
2019-10-27, Wouldn't that be GREAT for USA and all it's citizens? How can you have a Blatant LIAR running the Fraud Secret Impeachment Inquiry which is really another COUP against @realDonaldTrump to satisfy Democrats who are ALL a bunch of SORE LOSERS? @Fendi_Gucci_Gal

2019-10-27, He also said the tunnel collapsed in the explosion and there are reports that baghdadi was identified with biometrics. So they dug his head out of the collapsed tunnel after it had been thru an explosion and verified his identity? It may be true but seems a little strange...

2019-10-31, These claims won't change the fact that the Trump Admin just confirmed today that it wants to fully repeal the ACA with nothing to replace it with. So much for protecting people with pre-existing conditions. Much of your voters will be left holding the bag. They deserve better.

2019-11-03, Nobody cares what they call California everyone else calls it a Shit Hole State. And with that attachment it can still clean the majority of the ground
2019-11-03, Have you ever even been to a pacific forest? in the Sierras maybe? The steepness of the mountains would turn this machine on its head.
2019-11-03, The fires are created to get the funds from the Fed and then when they get the money as usual they don't use it to resolve the problem or help the people.  This scam has been going on for years.  Gov. Brown vetoed a bill to clear the bush in California no fires no money!
2019-11-03, As if fires are purposely set to get Federsl money makes any sense at all. PhD? Doubtful.
2019-11-03, At least read a summary of the mueller report.  The report says from the get go that there is no such crime of collusion  that is applicable.  So it goes into investigating conspiring with foreign entities which there is ample evidence of.
2019-11-03, Then it goes into laying out occurrences of obstruction of justice.  Many times it's not the original act that gets folks in real trouble it's the cover up.  Then now we have this Ukraine situation which is an egregious abuse of power and worthy of impeachment as well.
2019-11-03, When will people learn that you can't yield an inch on the field to Democrats especially when you've done nothing wrong.

2019-11-03, There was nothing wrong with the Call and he was perfectly within his right to say what he said. The unfortunate part are the Dirt bags who are trying  to say otherwise. And the Republicans who simply lack Integrity and Character.  Shamefully allowing this fiasco.
2019-11-03, Do anybody who trump can tell me which policies he is going to implement to continue the booming economy. Any plans in infrastructure clean water and air etc. I can't find any information about it.

2019-11-03, Most forest lands in California are federally owned. The majority of the fires weren't in the forest. There are strict laws regarding brush removal around homes where I live which had at least 10 separate fires and 50 homes destroyed. Residents take fire danger very seriously.

2019-11-04, There is no point trying to converse with individuals whose minds have been made up that Trump is being railroaded before all the facts come out. Numerous transcripts were released from the impeachment inquiry and they've dismissed them already without reading them.
2019-11-04, Let's not forget that Trump is still Individual1 in a case under SDNY and that the "Completely Exonerating" Mueller Report listed a few instances of obstruction of justice. The report states that the SC deferred to Congress to do something about it as he was forced by DOJ.

2019-11-11, And HRC was shady at both of them!
2019-11-11, If you are the most transparent president of all time allow your flunkies to testify. Then you come on the Hill and testify as well.
2019-11-11, If trump testified half the room would be rolling on the floor laughing and the other half would be on the floor sleeping...

2019-11-11, You committed your base to it. They believe it because they have to. Even as the facts mount against you. They've no choice. They're in too deep. The alternative is to admit they've been bamboozled from the beginning that their prospects were based on utter deception.
2019-11-11, Yeah Trump is the most Transparent President in history but not in a good way.
2019-11-11, That's not my job but I venture he lied about having sex with Stormy.(You didn't ever care when Clinton lied 24/7 or Obama or Hillary.)DJT stands between me & all you craven leftists hell bent on dismantling all societal norms I cherish. He's got my vote as long as he FIGHTS U.

2019-11-11, You withheld the aid for months to intimidate the new Ukraine administration. And that was on top of your threatening phone call "Just meet with Giuliani" you told Zelensky. Please resign.

2019-11-12, The average median income under President Bush rose only $400 over an 8-year period. Under President Obama it rose $975 over an 8-year period...And under my administration it rose $5000 over slightly more than just 2 1/2 years. That's a big difference.  - @realDonaldTrump
2019-11-12, Yes it is a big difference. But it's also total nonsense.  What is an average median?   It can be one or the other but not both.

2019-11-12, Maybe if Barr had a shred of integrity...
2019-11-12, But it was Trump's EO's lifting restrictions that allowed the economy to take off. But Obama spooge is difficult to clean up I get it.
2019-11-12, Actually if you compare the numbers fact is Obama's have been better. Things have actually slowed during Trump. I'll even be fair and factor in that the global economy has slowed so you can't fault Trump in that aspect but truth is Obama's numbers were stronger.
2019-11-12, We can always pray scriptures like Isaiah 54:17 and try to educate as many people as possible about what is happening. Remind them of how Democrats weaponized the agencies of government against candidate Trump and ignored corruption in their ranks.
2019-11-12, Oh? And which god is that? The one that puts kids in cages or the one that grabs em by the p@ssy?
2019-11-13, Trump will never answer questions for any reason under oath. He lies so much that he knows he will perjure himself. Remember the time in January 2017 when he raised his hand and swore to defend and protect the Constitution of the United States? That was also a lie.

2019-11-13, Obama built the cages. I don't want to see kids in cages. But the Dems paid people to come by the thousands (it happened the minute Trump won. There wasn't ever that many before. ). The parents knew the laws and chose to sacrifice their own kids while they were doing it.
2019-11-13, Then that would be secondhand and third hand knowledge. So I can go to a lawyer and say you did something just because I heard someone else say you did something. Let the investigation of you begin!!

2019-11-15, The facts are clear.---aid was held up. Then Executive Extortion Plan was discovered and outed.  Aid was then made available.---Republicans complained about closed-door sessions. But the last 2 days they had public visibility to their testimony. This is all they had.
2019-11-15, Do you think big businesses are finally taking Trump seriously and are reducing their risk from betting on China?Small/medium size businesses were expecting a better future under Trump the second he won given his campaign promises.Trump is fixing the US. The world sees this.

2019-11-15, Yes! Wow! I'm getting blasted by many on here. I guess I should have read the apparent  agreed upon rules' before expressing my opinion. I also stand corrected. That being said there is no need for rude & belittling replies. Just as there is no need for this impeachment inquiry.
2019-11-15, "Shifty Shiff" is one of the ever respectful Trump's little nicknames that you've used. Trumpublicans lied about hearing rules could be they're lying about other things. Could be Trump is a sociopath trying to save his behind.
2019-11-15, I think Giuliani is basically the source of this impeachment.I think he had a vested interest in Ukrane went to Trump with a story and Trump jumped at it.It's scary how easily influenced Trump is when he benefits from it as well.I don't think he put much other thought in it.
2019-11-15, I think Trump changed course because Russia instructed him to do so. he still wants to build his hotel &Putin must have dirt on him. He gave Yemen to Russia & now he's giving the Ukraine to Russia think about it. Thewas already appropriated & had nothing to do with Donnie.

2019-11-20, Maybe but he done more than you or I  or any member of Congress to get a few things done(ie all the trash collections in Democratic run cites) but all yo do remy is talk.
2019-11-20, Per Swalwell Laura Cooper just told @HouseIntel the Ukrainians first asked about @realDonaldTrump's hold on their security assistance on July 25 (same day as shakedown call). This testimony destroys the President's central defense that the Ukrainians did not know about hold.Quote TweetDavid Corn@DavidCornDC · Nov 20 2019.@Jim_Jordan keeps saying the aid was put on hold for only 55 days. Never mentions it was released *after* the congressional investigation began. But to be fair he just lost a favorite talking point: the Ukrainians didn't know about the hold on the money.ImpeachmentHearings
2019-11-20, Impeachment in the House is an indictment. If this were an ordinary prosecution there's no grand jury in America that would not return an indictment on the facts and evidence presented in these hearings.
2019-11-20, Unfortunately there are two notable exceptions @HouseGOP and @SenateGOP. @realDonaldTrump is a captain drilling holes in his own ship at sea and instead of stopping him the @GOP is defending his right to sink his ship. Just one problem the rest of us are on the ship.

2019-11-20, I don't doubt it. I just think it's the goal of the process we'll not see for awhile how it goes. I have Republican family that will stand by their man. I have a Republican co-worker not sure he can vote for him. I was independent until Trump now a Dem 
2019-11-20, Why is this important? Trump sees the writing on the wall; a trade deal with China unlikely now after Congress's Hong Kong rights bill.Apple will avoid some of the impacts of increased tariffs on China by manufacturing some of its products here in USA.
2019-11-20, Trumpers don't care what he does they will support him no matter what he says or does criminal or unethical they just don't care they've made that really clear by now.
2019-11-20,  This. And it's making his base look incredibly ignorant. The GOP are willing stooges here. Either he's lying about today's hearings is detached from reality or whoever is feeding him information is misleading him. Because the evidence against Trump is pretty damning.
2019-11-20, Actually it is our business. We need to see if our leader (no matter who) is not beholden to any foreign government.  Beholden means - owing thanks or having a duty to someone in return for help or a service.45 is most definitely beholden to Russia & probably Saudi Arabia.

2019-11-24, A dozen Navy SEALs testified against Gallagher. He was convicted of a crime. This is a slap in the face to all those brave enough to come forward and testify against him. You overrode a judicial process with a political decision then jammed it down the chain of command.
2019-11-24, Gallagher walked on the murder charge because one of Gallagher's friends shocked everyone and took the blame for it on the stand saying he'd suffocated the kid to death after Gallagher stabbed him.

2019-12-02, Don't you people ever get tired of crying Dems do it too?  Try spending some energy defending the president's policies when they are attacked instead of just whining about how both sides do it.   
2019-12-02, Unbelievable do you all really think Americans are that stupid to believe your talking points. An election cannot be overturned but if Trump wasn't so corrupt there wouldn't be an impeachment. We need law and order returned to our country ImpeachTrump BlueWave2020

2019-12-02, I believe it's an algorithm they use to determine if the user activity resembles that of a bot. Just by looking I'd have to agree that it IS actually a bot. And no it isn't difficult to program a bot to run under certain circumstances within a platform that's the problem.
2019-12-02, do you have any idea just how ridiculous you sound
2019-12-02, He doesn't even know that grammatically it should be republicans'  with an apostrophe. Of corse he doesn't realize how ridiculous he sounds. The guy is a complete buffoon.

2019-12-04, Donald Trump obviously doesn't understand how NATO functions. It's a recommended guideline for percentage of GDP a country should spend on defense not a cumulative military fund. It's our choice to spend 4% of GDP on defense. In times of peace countries spend less

2019-12-22, The tax cuts basically were a pathetic joke to the middle class.  The ones who mainly benefited were the rich and big corporations.  https://npr.org/2019/12/20/789540931/2-years-later-trump-tax-cuts-have-failed-to-deliver-on-gops-promises 
2019-12-22, Now the impeached president and the gop leader are pushing complete lies out to America and republicans hide in dark corners and don't say anything.   They are complicit.@MittRomney @marcorubio @SenSusanCollins @senatemajldr @SenCoryGardner
2019-12-22, THE FBI BROKE INTO MY HOUSE ONCE AND SPIED ON MY TOTALLY LEGAL CASSETTE TAPE DUPLICATION BUSINESS. HIGHLY CORRUPT PEOPLE!!!
2019-12-22, I wonder why Trump didn't seal all his records like Obama did. The birther thing started from HRC &  John Podesta. Funny how no real journalists questioned any of those facts.@DonaldJTrumpJr @KimStrassel @jimmy_dore @SkyNews @cnnbrk @MSNBC_Breaking @senatemajldr
2019-12-22, The dotard forgets that ImpeachedTrump prevented witnesses from attending? That is what crime bosses do to protect themselves from the truth.They followed the rules set up by a Republican-controlled House BEFORE you were elected. Are you in IdiotInChief or LiarInChief mode?
2019-12-22, @samsouleturner hey Mr finance how do I go about shorting the existence of civilization? Opportunity looks tremendous
2019-12-22, You are lying. Straight from the IG report: "We found no evidence the FBI attempted to place any CHS [spies] within the Trump campaign recruit members of the Trump campaign as CHS or task CHS to report on the Trump campaign."
2019-12-22, Oh come on man you must listen to this and think..."Is anyone going to believe this nonsense?"

2019-12-22, But I have seen alot of arrests. 5 in New Jersey recently for instance. They're working from the bottom up. Those at the top likely won't roll over but many at the bottom will & will name names. A way to connect the dots & sever rat lines!
2019-12-22, You would be a good one to be involved in decoding "Q" posts then. What you do is critical there! I hope you at least take a look at the decodes others do. Perhaps you can add insight where needed? There're many smart people like you who question & try to prove/disprove theories.
2019-12-22, The owner of Christian Today recently called for Trump's removal from office based partly upon his deranged twitter rants and it appeared that Trump who's desperate to keep the Evangelical vote was prepared to halt his endless steam of BS but the PSYCHO couldn't help himself.

2019-12-22, That's the seam they open to get into his hollow head to change hamsters on the wheel.
2019-12-22, I first pray for peace and then I pray that every congressman and woman be voted out of office and we start a clean slate with term limits so the deep state cannot  rise again!
2019-12-22, Honey don't use snopes for real research.  Test yourself and then you will know what is really true
2019-12-22, Again people every time he posted his Snopes. I posted a Snopes that said the opposite. I don't frickin use Snopes. He blocked me or something. Did he get rid of his Snopes and that is why you aren't realizing this?
2019-12-22, You fat fucking scumbag.
2019-12-22, Clinton was impeached. He was not convicted in the Senate. His Impeachment stands. There is no confusion.
2019-12-22, Most of us with critical thinking skills know that. But then you have attorneys well-versed in Constitutional law who say the opposite.
2019-12-22, This speech needs therapy...
2019-12-22, I don't know if that many are waking up or still running with it. It's hard to get folks to admit they made a mistake.
2019-12-22, No person should be harmed tortured or killed because of their sexual orientation.
2019-12-22, True. Sad that the @realDonaldTrump administration's actions don't match their words.
2019-12-22, I can't take much more of his atrocious spelling and grammar and 3rd grade way of speaking.
2019-12-22, He's still your president! Just wanted to take the wind out of that pre-emptively.
2019-12-22, That too.  Basically everything about him is odious.
2019-12-22, The President is a human projector.
2019-12-22, Because it's not a trial. Both sides present evidence at the trial. Grand juries determine whether there's enough evidence to indict.
2019-12-22, Dude .. or .. man - child .. your pathetic with your excuses for the Trumptard's attacks. You are a weak dude. You match up well with your weak-spineless party.
2019-12-22, Stop the gaslighting! And do something about your hair.
2019-12-22, The truth isn't gaslighting. Though when you're as much of an asshat as you are truth isn't important to you.
2019-12-23, Admiral Akbar: It's a bubble! 
2019-12-23, Luckily we have a man who is our President but also one of the most redeemed Christian men in all of history. Jesus is here for the sinners and offers his forgiveness to President Trump. He has been forgiven and washed clean as a newborn nuclear submarine.AMENMAGA

2019-12-23, If she refuses Senate Republicans should take matters into our own hands.  We are in charge of the Senate   not Pelosi or Schumer.Speaker Pelosi's actions are an affront to the Constitution the Senate and denies President @realDonaldTrump his day in court.
2019-12-23, No trial until she selects the managers no managers until the rules are agreed upon.   What don't you get Blanche?
2019-12-23, what was it that you said... let me see if i remember....  Oh yes here it is.  "If we nominate Trump we will get destroyed.......and we will deserve it."You went from the above to being an accomplice.  You should be ashamed but I know you are not.
2019-12-23, Does that mean the Senate will have relevant witnesses and documents or did you still want to pretend that someone else is on trial besides you?
2019-12-23, But he has an ulterior motive for the stupid. Some Scottish wind turbines were mean to him. 
2019-12-23, Hey there LeningradLindsey . Just tell trump to release the obstructed witnesses and documents and it will all be good. You do think they will prove him innocent don't you?
2019-12-23, Because this is the trial not the indictment 
2019-12-23, Imagine what it'll look like after four more years of President Trump! The sky is the limit! Thank you for being the greatest President of all time!
2019-12-23, REPUBLICANS  better learn to fight fire with fire or forever be run over by corrupt Democrats.
2019-12-23, He hasn't been impeached yet.
2019-12-23, As soon as the first article passed the house vote he was officially impeached. That's basic 9th grade civics.
2019-12-23, Yes! Your self destruction and full blown dementia and exposure of your false financial statements! Yay!
2019-12-23, Bwahahahahaha.  The Supreme Court cannot force the House to turn over articles of impeachment.  The House has impeached the President.
2019-12-23, Yep. 100% agree except for all the things you just said aren't true.
2019-12-23, Commit to an impartial process and Speaker Pelosi will send the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate. FYI...Impartiality of jurors is a constitutional obligation LenigradLindsey
2019-12-23, This is how it goes so far... only three presidents in U.S. history have been impeached by the House. You have to add on "by the House."
2019-12-23, Given that the house is the only place where impeachment happens its implied. You don't actually have to say it
2019-12-23, Last week news broke that @RealDonaldTrump changed the rules to let pork processors include more pig crap genitals and hair in your food and insanely no one seems to care.
2019-12-23, Trump has worn everyone out!
2019-12-23, Someone hasn't explained this talking point to you clearly enough have they.

2019-12-23, Trump 2020!
2019-12-23, I am so hoping there will soon be a telling walk of senators to the WH to tell him the gig is up.
2019-12-23, That's nice to picture.
2019-12-23, Impeachment up 100%
2019-12-23, You forgot the BEST accomplishment: Trump was impeached!!! God bless America and Merry Christmas to us!!
2019-12-23, Merry Impeachmas and Treasons Greetings!
2019-12-23, Yes with witnesses. With subpoenaed documents. With intelligent questioning. Not like republicans in the House who just stood up and screamed a lot. We know you don't want that.
2019-12-23, The tyrant always comes in the form of the protector. No matter the issue the person who claims to protect something (whatever it is) is the one in the best position to assault it because ppl won't challenge their selected guardian. I always use the 2A as it's a great example..

2019-12-24, Its gonna happen. He may not get removed but he is already impeached. Done deal.
2019-12-24, So you're on board with him pulling the dictator card?  Straight out of Evo Morales' playbook. That is exactly what he did reasoning and all. Look how it worked out for him. I wouldn't expect you to know history or cultures outside the four corners of an Applebees menu.

2019-12-24, We must take back the House in 2020.  We must deliver a message that the Do Nothing democrats will not be tolerated.
2019-12-24, They have passed 400 bills & still had time to impeach the worst President this country has ever had.
2019-12-24, Asked by a member of the military this morning about his holiday plans Trump said I really pretty much work. That's what I like to do." This afternoon he went golfing again.

2019-12-26, Millions of working Americans have 401Ks that are impacted by the stock market.82% of middle income earners received an average tax cut of 1k a year. Personally my wage has grown by 20% since the corporate tax cuts went into effect and I received a bonus at the time.

2019-12-27, @realDonaldTrump is so close to exposing all the Obama and Democrat collusion and kickbacks from the Ukrainian aid that they had no choice but to impeach him. That's why they did it so fast to slow him down. I'm still looking for the investigation into joe Biden's quid pro quo

2019-12-29, You do realize you don't have to commit an actual crime to be impeached right?  It's a political process.  And Trump has indeed committed treasonous acts. The conflicted Lindsey Graham stated that regarding Clinton's impeachment. It's a cleansing of the office as Graham said

2019-12-30, Trump's base will vote for him regardless of what unethical BS he pulls. However getting these events out in the open can only help the cause of truth which is what any real patriot wants. America wants to hear from the witnesses Trump refused to allow to testify!

2019-03-01, Is it just me or does it seem like @realDonaldTrump is in a new type of death spiral we've only hoped would happen?  There appears to be momentum now?   This week was a special kind of super bad.
