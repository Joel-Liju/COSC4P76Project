training data

The training data the Exponential moving average(EMA) of the USD vs CAD forex market, from dec 31st 2018 to dec 31st 2020.
After calculating the EMA for all of the days, then the value in the training data is calculated by taking the previous days EMA and subtracting with the current day's EMA.
This is done by jan 1st of 2019 to dec 31st 2020. For example, in the training data jan 1st 's data is taken as EMA of 1st jan 2019 subtracted by EMA of 31st dec 2018.
However, for the weekends, the data is not present as the forex market doesn't operate then, so for some data, the EMA might be from the last friday.
Another important point is that, each value represents a day.

the label

Each of the label for each day is calculated by taking into account the close of a given day, i.e. at what price did the market exit that day.
So this is done by, taking the previous day's close value and substracting it from the current day's close, if the value is positive, then the market went up, however, if the value is negative, the market went down. If it is not fluctuate then it is neither.
